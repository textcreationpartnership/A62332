            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Reader may pleaſe to take notice, that the diligent and learned Author of this Hiſtory, (to the writing of which he was commanded, and therein aſsiſted by the Chancellor of <hi>Sweden</hi>) hath in the whole work taken care to juſtify what he relates, from the faith of authentic records, the teſtimony of Hiſtorians, and the Diſcourſes of <hi>Laplanders</hi> themſelves, with whom he had ready opportunities of converſe. And this he hath don ſo preciſely, that having in the contexture of his work, given a full account of what he thought ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in the writings, or narratives to which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers; he afterwards conſtantly puts down at length the very words of his Authors, a great part of which are in the Swediſh Tongue. Now in this Edition we have ſpared our ſelves the labor of ſuch repetition; which we hope will not be regretted by the Reader, who we ſuppoſe would not have bin much edified by them. As to the ſubject here diſcours'd of, twill not be needfull to give a character of it. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Action, and thoſe public murders in which other Hiſtories triumph, have no ſhare here. Hunger, cold and ſolitude are enemies that engage all the fortitude of this People: and where ſo much paſsive valor is neceſſary, we may diſpenſe with the want of Active. Amidſt the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity and darkneſs which reign in <hi>Lapland,</hi> there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſtrictures of light, which will entertain the eie of the moſt knowing obſerver; as the Stars are no leſs remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable then is the Sun it ſelf. However the Reader will
<pb facs="tcp:98689:4"/>not fail to meet here with what may gratify his curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. Warmer Climates having all the comforts and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of life plentifully beſtowed upon them, are but a more diſtant home; where we have little elſe talk'd of, then what we daily ſee among our ſelves: but here it is indeed, where, rather then in <hi>America,</hi> we have a new World diſcovered: and thoſe extravagant falſehoods, which have commonly past in the narratives of theſe Northern Countries, are not ſo inexcuſable for their being lies, as that they were told without temtation; the real truth being equally entertaining, and incredible.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Name of <hi>Lapland.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THIS Country doth not every where paſs by the ſame name. By ſome 'tis called <hi>Lappia,</hi> as <hi>Johann. Magnus</hi> in the Preface of his hiſtory, and <hi>Saxo Grammat.</hi> in his 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> book; by others <hi>Lapponia,</hi> as <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> in the explication of his Map of <hi>Scandinavia,</hi> and <hi>Ziegler</hi> in his deſcription of the Northern Countries, and before theſe <hi>Ericus Verſalienſis,</hi> and after them <hi>Andr. Buraeus.</hi> The <hi>Swedes</hi> uſually call the Country <hi>Lapmarkia,</hi> in whoſe language <hi>Mark</hi> ſignifies Land; the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Norwegians, Laplandia,</hi> and alſo <hi>Findmarkia,</hi> as appears from <hi>Petr. Claudus</hi> deſcription of <hi>Norway:</hi> for no one can gather any thing elſe but an account of this Country, from his whole 38<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapt. which himſelf too ſeems to intimate, when he promiſes more about <hi>Findmarkia</hi> in his deſcription of <hi>Lapland.</hi> Of i'ts being call'd <hi>Findmark,</hi> I ſhall ſpeak in another place; Now we will ſee why 'tis call'd <hi>Lapponia</hi> and <hi>Lappia,</hi> the Etymology of which words is not yet agreed upon by the Learned. <hi>Ziegler</hi> thinks they were named ſo by the <hi>Germans,</hi> from the dulneſs and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of the people, which the word <hi>Lappi</hi> ſignifies amongſt them; but this ſeems improbable, ſince this Country is but of late known to the <hi>Germans,</hi> and none of their antient Writers make any mention of <hi>Lappia.</hi> Moreover, the <hi>Finlanders, Swedes</hi> and <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> who differ much in their language from one another, as well as from the <hi>Germans,</hi> call it all by the ſame name; and the <hi>Germans,</hi> who are ſo remote from <hi>Lapland,</hi> could not tranſmit this name to theſe more Northern Countries, eſpecially when they had little or no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with them. Neither are the people ſo very dull and ſtupid; as <hi>Ziegler</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf afterwards acknowledges, when he confeſſes they are good at the needle, and make delicate embroidered clothes. Neither can I aſſent to <hi>Wexionius</hi>'s opinion, that the <hi>Swedes</hi> gave them this name from their wearing of <hi>Skins;</hi> for <hi>Lapper</hi> and <hi>Skinlapper</hi> do not ſignify skins, but the ſame as the Greeks <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (in Engliſh <hi>Rags</hi>) from whence <hi>Ol. Petr. Nieuren,</hi> who writ of <hi>Lapland</hi> in <hi>Guſlavus Adolphus</hi>'s time, derives their name from their coming into <hi>Swedland</hi> every year with rags <hi>lapt</hi> about them, which is the ſignification of <hi>Lapp</hi> in that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98689:7"/>language. But they do not deſerve that name, meerly for this reaſon, any more than the <hi>Finlanders</hi> and others, for they are generally cloth'd in good woollen garments, as we ſhall ſhew hereafter. <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks they are call'd <hi>Lapps</hi> from running or <hi>leaping,</hi> but <hi>Loepa,</hi> which in the Swediſh language ſignifies to run, is writ with a ſingle <hi>P,</hi> and the name of this Country with a double one: and theſe People naturally are no great runners, tho by an art they have of ſliding over the frozen ſnow, they are very ſwift in their motions. Some think that the Inhabitants do not denominate the Country, but the Country the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, as in the name of <hi>Norwegians</hi> and others, which ſeems to be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by this, becauſe <hi>Ol. Magnus</hi> calls them <hi>Lappomanni,</hi> after the manner of <hi>Nordmanni, Westmanni,</hi> and <hi>Sudermanni,</hi> in which words <hi>Manni</hi> ſignifying <hi>Men,</hi> they were call'd <hi>Lappomanni, i. e.</hi> Men of <hi>Lappia.</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="bottom">Johann. Tornaeus.</note> Others fancy that the name of the Country is deriv'd from <hi>Lappu,</hi> which in the <hi>Finnonick</hi> language is <hi>furthermost,</hi> becauſe it lies in the fartheſt part of <hi>Scandinavia.</hi> There is yet another opinion which may ſeem no leſs plauſible then any of the former, which agrees as well with the ſignification of the word <hi>Lapp</hi> among the <hi>Laplanders</hi> themſelves, as the credit given to what has been matter of fact, <hi>viz.</hi> that 'twas call'd <hi>Lappia,</hi> not from its ſituation, or other ſuch like acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but from the <hi>Lappi</hi> that inhabited it. So that I take <hi>Lappi</hi> to ſignify no other than <hi>baniſh't</hi> perſons, which is the genuine ſignification of <hi>Lapp</hi> in the <hi>Lapland</hi> language; for the <hi>Laplanders</hi> were originally <hi>Finlanders,</hi> and from leaving their Country may be preſum'd to have took their name; and that not of their own chooſing, but the <hi>Finlanders</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="bottom">Ol. Petr. Nieuren. Plantin. jun. Praef. <hi>M S.</hi> Lexic. Lappon.</note> impoſition, with whom to <hi>Lapp</hi> ſignifies to run away: whence the compellation ſeeming ſomething ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, no perſon of quality to this day will endure to be call'd by it, tho from the <hi>Finlanders</hi> others Nations, as the <hi>Germans, Swedes</hi> and <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> have learnt to call them ſo. But they of <hi>Lappia <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>menſis</hi> ſtile themſelves <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mienladti,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Lappia Tornenſis, Sameednan,</hi> from the word <hi>Sabmi</hi> or <hi>Same;</hi> the ſignification of which, and whence they had it, we ſhall ſee hereafter.</p>
               <p>At what time this Country and it's inhabitants were firſt diſtinguiſh't by theſe names <hi>Lappia</hi> and <hi>Lappi,</hi> 'tis hard to prove: 'tis certain 'twas but of late, for the words are not found in any antient writer, neither in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> who mentions their neighbours and forefathers the <hi>Finlanders,</hi> nor in <hi>Ptolomy, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus, Anton. Augustus, Rutilius,</hi> or others, neither in Authors nearer home (not to name <hi>Jornandes, Paul Warnefrid,</hi> &amp;c.) nor in thoſe who have writ the actions of <hi>Heraud</hi> and <hi>Boſa,</hi> or <hi>Goetricus</hi> and <hi>Rolfus,</hi> or King <hi>Olafus</hi> in the <hi>Iſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dick, Norwegian</hi> or <hi>Gothick</hi> language: we find nothing of them in <hi>Adam Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſis,</hi> whoſe diligence in writing of the Northern Countries, his <hi>Scandinavia</hi> ſufficiently teſtifies; or in <hi>Sturliſonius,</hi> who writ very accuratly of theſe parts in his own language. Therefore I cannot be ſo eaſily perſuaded with <hi>Grotius</hi> to believe <hi>Cluverius,</hi> who ſays they were mention'd in the <hi>Peutingerian</hi> Tables, the Author of which is thought to have liv'd at leaſt before <hi>Theodoſius</hi>'s time, <hi>i. e.</hi> 600 years before <hi>Adam Bremenſis:</hi> how then could he, that was none of the beſt Geographers, if we may beleive <hi>Welſerus,</hi> and very far diſtant from theſe parts, give us any account of them, ſince <hi>Adam Bremenſis,</hi> who was ſo near a neighbour, and had commerce with thoſe that lived there, could give us none? Beſides, in that Table the <hi>Sarmatians</hi> are called <hi>Lupiones,</hi> with whom the <hi>Lappi</hi> were nothing concerned; neither doth any antient Author ſay they were ſeated ſo far Northward: wherefore the <hi>Lupiones</hi> there deſcribed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98689:7"/>are any People rather then the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> for at that time, when the Author writ, they were not ſo much as known to any of their neighbours, the <hi>Gothick Norwegian</hi> or <hi>Daniſh</hi> writers. The firſt that mentions <hi>Lapland</hi> is <hi>Saxo Gramat.</hi> Hiſt. Dan. l. 5. who lived and wrote about <hi>Ann.</hi> 1190, and therefore was after <hi>Adam Bremenſis</hi> (who lived about 1077) near 130 years, in which interval this name muſt needs come firſt in uſe. For <hi>Saxo</hi> making mention of ſuch a Country a great while before, in the time of <hi>Frotho</hi> the third contemporary to <hi>Alricus</hi> King of Swedland (who they ſay lived before Chriſt) doth not prove that 'twas called ſo then, but that that Country might afterwards have had this appellation; and I am fully perſwaded, that <hi>Adam Bremenſis</hi> would not have omitted this name if he had had any knowledge of it. Afterward <hi>Er. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſalienſis</hi> ſpeaks of it about 1470 <hi>i. e.</hi> almoſt 300 years after <hi>Saxo,</hi> and 200 before this preſent time. After them <hi>Jac. Ziegler</hi> made a large and learned deſcription of it, by which it came to be known all over <hi>Europe.</hi> For however we may meet with the name <hi>Lappia</hi> in <hi>Saxo,</hi> none but the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Finlanders,</hi> before <hi>Zieglers</hi> time, knew any thing of it. And ſo much for the names of <hi>Lapland.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>THE true and exact ſituation of this Country the Antients ſeem not to have ſufficiently diſcovered. <hi>Saxo</hi> makes it bordering upon <hi>Jamtia,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending its ſelf as far, or rather lying as it were between <hi>Helſingia</hi> and <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> when in theſe words he ſays <hi>the Provinces of the</hi> Helſingi, Iarnberi, Iemti, <hi>with both the</hi> Lappia's, <hi>as likewiſe</hi> Finnia <hi>and</hi> Eſtia <hi>paid annual tribute to one Domarus. Ericus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſalienſis</hi> ſeems to make it a part of <hi>Finland,</hi> miſtaking it for a certain part of that Kingdome ſo called, on the one ſide adjoining to <hi>Swedland,</hi> on the other to <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> giving it a place between <hi>Carelia</hi> and <hi>Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landia. Ol. Magn.</hi> in his Table, and ſo his brother <hi>Johan. Magnus</hi> in the Preface of his Hiſtory, place it higher then the weſtern <hi>Bothnia,</hi> making neighbours to it <hi>Scrikfinnia</hi> furtheſt towards the North, and <hi>Biarmia</hi> towards the Eaſt; though ſome<note n="a" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Buraeus</hi> in his deſcr. of Swedland.</note> think there is no ſuch place as <hi>Scrikfinnia,</hi> as it is certain there is none in thoſe parts at this day called by that name. But yet we muſt not ſlightly paſs over the unanimous opinion of ſo many learned men, eſpecially <hi>Saxo,</hi> not a little knowing in the Northern affairs, who have all not barely named it, but have deſcribed the humours of the Inhabitants, their manners, habits and faſhion of their governments, with other matters belonging to them. Inſtead of the <hi>Scrickfinni</hi> or <hi>Scricfinni</hi> of <hi>Johan.</hi> and <hi>Ol. Magn.</hi> I would rather read it <hi>Scrito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finni;</hi> and as for <hi>Skidfinni</hi> as <hi>Adr. Burae</hi> would have it, all the Antients, what ever elſe they differ in, will agree in this, that there muſt be an <hi>R</hi> in the word. <hi>Jornandez</hi> calls them <hi>Scretfennae, Paul. Warnefrid.</hi> and <hi>Diacon. Scrito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bini</hi> changing <hi>f</hi> in <hi>b</hi> (of which and ſome other things of the like nature I will treat in due time and place) <hi>Adam Bremenſis Scritefinni:</hi> and the Greeks agree in this writing, ſo that we ought not to doubt of the Latines. <hi>Procopius</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:98689:8"/>will have them ſometimes <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, other times <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Beſides 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ſince the <hi>Scritefinni</hi> are the ſame with the <hi>Finni,</hi> whoſe Etymology in their own language is from leaping, by an art they have, by which with crooked pieces of wood under their feet like a bow they hunt wild beaſts; they could not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take their name from <hi>Skidh,</hi> ſignifying the wooden ſhoes themſelves, but from their leaping, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſwift running with them, which doubtleſs antiently was meant by <hi>Skriida,</hi> and which the Author cited by <hi>Warnius</hi> in the 46 page of his Lexicon confirms, where he relates the form of an oath made by <hi>Hafur,</hi> that he would preſerve the peace <hi>Quamdiu Finnur skriidar, i. e.</hi> as long as the <hi>Finlanders</hi> continued their manner of leaping. As for the Etymology that is there given, that it ſignifies their wandring up and down, 'tis altogether falſe, for <hi>Skridsko</hi> at this day denotes thoſe wooden ſhoes which they run upon the ice with; neither doth <hi>Skirida</hi> ſignify any thing elſe among the Antients but to glide along the ground, for they do not take up one foot after the other, as in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon running, but carrying themſelves ſteady upon the frozen ſnow, they move forward ſtooping a little, as ſhall be ſhewn hereafter. And perhaps this is the onely cauſe that they are called <hi>Himantopodes,</hi> People creeping upon their knees; which agrees exactly with theſe <hi>Scritofinni:</hi> for they hearing that <hi>Skriida</hi> was to creep along, what could they fancy the <hi>Scritofinni</hi> to be, but People not going like other men, but crawling forward like creeping animalls, but of this I ſhall ſpeak more at large when I come to the <hi>Laplanders</hi> gliding upon the ice. That which I would chiefly evince here, is, that there are ſuch a people rightly called <hi>Scritofinni,</hi> and the Country which they inhabit is <hi>Scritofinnia</hi> or <hi>Scrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finnia,</hi> and that there is no reaſon we ſhould think there was no ſuch place, ſince there are thoſe who are called <hi>Scritfinni, i. e. Finlanders,</hi> who run upon the ice with wooden ſhoes, whoſe Country from thence may well be called <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofinnia.</hi> And the ſame may be urged for <hi>Biarmia</hi> againſt thoſe that will not allow there is any ſuch place. For firſt the antient Writers making frequent mention of it, as that Author of the Hiſtory thereof, calls it often <hi>Biarmaland</hi> in the old <hi>Gothick</hi> or <hi>Iſlandick</hi> language, who alſo calls the King of it <hi>Hereker</hi> in Ch. 7. and his two Sons, the one <hi>Roerik</hi> the other <hi>Siggeir. Saxo</hi> likewiſe in his 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> book, ſpeaks of a certain King of this place, who reigned in the time of <hi>Regner</hi> King of the <hi>Danes,</hi> making it border upon <hi>Finland,</hi> when he ſays the King of <hi>Biarmia</hi> fled for refuge to <hi>Matullus,</hi> who then reigned in <hi>Finland.</hi> But now granting there were antiently ſuch names as <hi>Biarmia</hi> and <hi>Scritfinnia,</hi> it remains doubtfull ſtill whether they were diſtinct Countries or no. All Authors except <hi>Johan.</hi> and <hi>Ol. Magn.</hi> ſeem to make them the ſame, <hi>Procop. Jornand. Paul. Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frid.</hi> and <hi>Adam Bremenſis</hi> ſpeak of <hi>Scritfinnia,</hi> but none of <hi>Biarmia,</hi> and the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern writers do juſt contrary. <hi>Saxo</hi> indeed mentions them both, but not at the ſame time: once in his Preface he names <hi>Scritfinnia,</hi> leaving out <hi>Biarmia,</hi> in other places he names <hi>Biarmia</hi> omitting the other; from whence I am almoſt of opinion that 'tis the ſame Country called by native Writers <hi>Biarmia,</hi> by forreign <hi>Scritfinnia.</hi> We may add further that as <hi>Adam Bremenſis</hi> makes <hi>Scritfinnia</hi> next to <hi>Helſingia,</hi> the Author of the Hiſtory of <hi>Herand</hi> and <hi>Boſa</hi> ſets <hi>Biarmia</hi> in the ſame place, ſpeaking of ſome Woods in it, and Rivers that emty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the <hi>Sinus Bothnicus</hi> or bay of <hi>Ganduia</hi> next to <hi>Helſingia.</hi> And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over as the <hi>Scritfinni</hi> are a People of <hi>Finland,</hi> which not onely their name, but an old Chorographick Table commended by <hi>Grotius</hi> doth intimate, diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Fenni</hi> into the <hi>Scritfenni</hi> and <hi>Redefenni,</hi> ſo 'tis probable of the <hi>Biarmians</hi>

Moreover the <hi>Biarmians</hi> have many other things like the <hi>Finlanders,</hi> as the Art of darting, of Magic, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that <hi>Biarmia</hi> may be a Colony of <hi>Finland,</hi> whoſe People were, called by Strangers, from their <hi>skirring</hi> along, or gliding upon the ſnow, <hi>Scritofinni.</hi> But now ſuppoſing all this true, and that the <hi>Biarmia</hi> of the Ancients, and <hi>Scrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finnia</hi> were the ſame, 'tis a queſtion ſtill whether <hi>Lapland</hi> be diſtinct from them or not. <hi>Joh.</hi> and <hi>Ol. Magnus</hi> in their Geographic Tables and deſcriptions, make them diſtinct Countries. But that cannot be; for if <hi>Scritfinnia</hi> and <hi>Biarmia</hi> reach one way to <hi>Helſingia</hi> and <hi>Jamtia,</hi> on the other to <hi>Finland;</hi> if they lye ſo near theſe Provinces, and extend to the Bay of <hi>Bothnia</hi> (both which have bin demonſtrated before) I do not ſee where <hi>Lapland</hi> can have any place at all. And the ſame Authors are alſo miſtaken in putting it South of <hi>Biarmia</hi> and <hi>Scritfinnia,</hi> whereas the Antients placed theſe beyond it. For that they mean't only by <hi>Biarmia</hi> that which the Swedes now call <hi>Trennes,</hi> appears to be falſe from what has bin ſaid before: for where are any Rivers in <hi>Trennes</hi> that run into the Bay of <hi>Bothnia?</hi> and how is it bordering upon <hi>Finland?</hi> Wherefore contrary to <hi>Joh.</hi> and <hi>Ol. Magnus,</hi> I think rather that <hi>Lapland</hi> is the ſame that was firſt by the Inhabitants called <hi>Biarmia,</hi> by Strangers <hi>Scritfinnia,</hi> then changing the name for ſome of the reaſons here produced, it came to be <hi>Lappia</hi> or <hi>Lapponia;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from <hi>Jamtia</hi> and <hi>Angermannia,</hi> goes all about each <hi>Bothnia,</hi> and at length ends in the extremities of <hi>Carelia</hi> and <hi>Finland,</hi> ſo as to comprehend all the whole tract from the North even to the main Ocean, the white Sea, and the Lake <hi>Ladek,</hi> which are the very bounds of old <hi>Biarmia</hi> and <hi>Scritfinnia.</hi> But that it went as far as the Ocean, the Antients ſeem not to have ſo well underſtood; nor indeed <hi>Johan.</hi> and <hi>Ol. Magnus,</hi> who in thoſe parts have made <hi>Scritfinnia</hi> and <hi>Biarmia</hi> different Countries from <hi>Lapland.</hi> So alſo <hi>Damianus Goes,</hi> who, whatever he knew of <hi>Lapland,</hi> had it from them, ſays it extends it ſelf to unknown Regions, becauſe he knew not who lived further towards the North Sea. But the Antients have placed there, beſides the <hi>Scritfinni,</hi> the <hi>Cynocephali, Buſti, Troglodytes, Pygmies, Cyclops's,:</hi> and ſome others, paſſing by the <hi>Himantopodes,</hi> of whom we have ſpoken before: tho in this age none doubts but the <hi>Laplanders</hi> inhabit it all, and thoſe who have ſailed along thoſe Coaſts have met with none others but <hi>Laplanders.</hi> In fine <hi>Charles</hi> the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> King of <hi>Swedland</hi> in the year 1600, being deſirous to know the truth of that Country, ſent two famous Mathematicians, <hi>M. Aron. Forſius</hi> a Swediſh Profeſſour, and <hi>Hicronymus Birk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holten</hi> a German, with inſtruments, and all neceſſaries to make what diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries they could of <hi>Lapland;</hi> who at their return, did certify, and make it out, that beyond the Elevation of the Pole 73 degrees there was no Continent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North but the great frozen Sea, and that the fartheſt point was <hi>Norcum</hi> or <hi>Norcap,</hi> not far from the Caſtle of <hi>Wardhouſe.</hi> But of this diſtant <hi>Lapland</hi> thoſe that are curious may enquire at their leiſure, we purpoſe to treat here only of that which is ſubject to the Government of the <hi>Swedes;</hi> and this is a vaſt Country, thought by <hi>Paulinus</hi> in his hiſtory of the North, of equall extent almoſt with all <hi>Swedland</hi> properly ſo called. <hi>Andr. Buraeus</hi> ſays it contains in length above 100 German miles, and in breadth 90. All this Country comes now under the name of <hi>Lapland,</hi> in which all agree that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98689:9"/>ever deſcribed it, and if we would take an account of the Climate of it by this vaſt compaſs of Earth, we muſt begin from the 64<hi rend="sup">th</hi> degree of latitude, and ſo to the 71; but in longitude it muſt extend at leaſt to the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Meridian, or more. Moreover if we will compute the longitude from journies that have bin made thither, all hitherto have unanimouſly put the beginning of it about the 38<hi rend="sup">th</hi> degree, and the end in the 65<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. And this may ſuffice partly for an account of the ſituation of <hi>Lapland</hi> in general; and partly of that which is ſubject to the <hi>Swedes. Dam. à Goes,</hi> a Knight of Portugall, ſets its bounds thus in his deſcription of Spain: <hi>Lapland is divided into the Eaſtern and Weſtern part, the Bothnick Sea coming between. The extremity of it is Tornia. Eaſtward it reaches to the white Lake, towards the North comprehending diverſe Provinces, and extends it ſelf beyond all knowledge. On the Weſt towards Iſland it joins to part of Norway, and on the other ſide of Norway 'tis bounded with Swedland, Finland, and both the Bothnia's.</hi> But <hi>Ol. Petr. Nieuren</hi> confutes this of the <hi>Bothnic</hi> Sea lying between; for ſo part of <hi>Lapland</hi> would lie in <hi>Finland</hi> or <hi>Ostrobothnia,</hi> part in <hi>Weſtrobothnia,</hi> which every one knows is falſe: and the very vulgar can tell ſo much, that the <hi>Bothnic</hi> Sea comes not any where within 18 or 20 miles of <hi>Lapland:</hi> tho this ought not to paſs beyond <hi>Damianus</hi>'s time, ſince <hi>Nieurenius</hi> himſelf confeſſes in another place, that the <hi>Laplanders</hi> had their feat about the <hi>Bothnic</hi> Sea, but that afterwards they were driven out, of which I ſhall ſpeak hereafter. I will only add here a Table of the latitudes and longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of the chiefeſt Places, as they were taken by <hi>M. Aronis Forſius</hi> and <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronymus Birckholten</hi> Ann. 1600.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the temperature of the Air, and ſoil of <hi>Lapland.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WE have ſeen how <hi>Lapland</hi> is ſituate; let us next proceed to other particularities of it. That 'tis very near the Pole appears from its lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, inſomuch that for ſome months in the Summer the Sun here never ſets, and on the contrary in the Winter it never riſes; which <hi>Herberſten</hi> ſays is but forty days, and tho three hours in the night the body of it is ſomething darkned, ſo that his raies appear not, yet there is ſo much light, that they continue their work all the while. Indeed the ſame account is not to be taken of the whole Country, ſince part of it lies nearer, and part further diſtant from the Pole; and of theſe too ſome parts are more Eaſt, and ſome more to the Weſt, from whence 'tis that with ſome of them the Sun is ſcarce above the Horizon for ſo many daies as he pretends. And altho in the Summer it never ſets and goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Earth, yet neither does it riſe much above it, but as it were kiſſes and gently glides along the Horizon for the moſt part; as likewiſe in the Winter when loweſt it is not much beneath it: which is the reaſon that tho they have one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued night for ſome months, yet every day the Sun comes ſo near, that it makes a kind of twilight. <hi>Joh. Magnus</hi> ſaies that in the abſence of the Sun there are two twilights, one in the morning, the other in the evening, in which thoſe poor remainders of day provide that the night ſhould not be utterly deſtructive. And by how much the Sun is farther abſent, the light of the Moon is clearer. Hence <hi>Petr. Claud.</hi> ſaies that when the Moon ſhines they go a fiſhing, and diſpatch all other neceſſaries that are to be done without doors; and when it does not, if the air be clear, even the light of the Stars ſo much abates the darkneſs, that the horrour of the night is much leſſened, and there is light enough for the diſpatch of ſeverall buſineſſes, which is farther aſſiſted by the whiteneſs of the Snow. The Air of <hi>Lapland</hi> is cold, but freſh and clear, and conſequently very wholeſome, being much purified by the winds which are here very frequent and violent. It has bin atteſted to me by eye-witneſſes, that there riſes a certain wind out of the Sea, which beginning to blow raiſes preſently ſuch thick and dark clouds even in the midſt of Summer, that they utterly hinder the ſight, and in the Winter drives the ſnow with ſuch force and quantity, that if any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be ſurpriſed abroad, he hath no other remedy but to throw himſelf on the ground with ſome garment over him, ſuffering himſelf to be quite buried in ſnow till the ſtorm is paſt, which don, he riſes up, and betakes himſelf to the next Cortage he can meet, all paths and roads being hid in the ſnow. But the ſtrongeſt and moſt irreſiſtible winds are upon the Mountains, where they throw down all
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98689:10"/>things they meet with, and carry them away by their violence into far diſtant places, where they are never ſeen or heard of afterwards. Their only help againſt theſe is to convey themſelves into dens and caves. Here is rain as in other places, ſometimes more, and ſometimes leſs, but in the midſt of Summer, this as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the neighbouring Countries have very ſeldom any at all. Snow they have more often, and ſo much that in the Winter it covers all the Country, of which they make this advantage, that they can travel the more ſecurely in the night; for the light of the Moon reflected from the ſnow, enlightens all the fields, that they can diſcern and avoid any pits, precipices and wild Beaſts, that would otherwiſe annoy them: ſo convenient are the wayes for any journy, that two rein deer will draw a greater load over the trodden ſnow, then a Cart and ten Horſes can in the fields at other times. Theſe ſnows in ſome places, as on the tops of their higheſt hills, remain perpetually, and are never melted by the ſtrongeſt heat of the Sun. In the upper part of <hi>Lapland</hi> there are Mountains riſing to ſuch a vaſt hight, that the ſnow continues upon them Summer and Winter, and is never diſſolved, but in other places the Land is every year over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown with floods of melted ſnow. They have alſo very great froſts and miſts, and good ſtore of them, which ſometimes ſo thicken the air, that the ſight is quite obſtructed, and Paſſengers cann't diſtinguiſh one man from another to ſalute or avoid him, tho he be come cloſe up to them. It is ſo extreme cold here in the Winter, that 'tis not to be endured but by thoſe who have bin bred up in it. The ſwifteſt Rivers are ſometimes frozen ſo hard, that the ice is more than three or four cubits thick; and their greateſt Lakes and deepeſt Seas bear any burdens whatever. Nor is the Summer, which to ſome may ſeem incredible, more moderately hot. For tho the Sun be very low, and his raies oblique, yet lying upon them ſo long together, their force is ſtrangely increaſt; the only allay being from the vapors riſing out of the neighbouring Sea, and from the ſnows, which as well in Summer as Winter continue undiſſolv'd in hollow places between the hills. As for Spring and Autumn they know neither, there being ſo very little ſpace between the extremity of cold in the Winter, and heat in Summer, that by Strangers 'tis look't upon as a miracle to ſee every thing ſpringing freſh and green, when but a week before all things were overwhelm'd with froſt and ſnow. <hi>Ol. Petr. Nieuren.</hi> has obſerved it as a memorable thing, and which he would not have believ'd from any one had he not ſeen it himſelf, that in the year 1616, June 24, going to the Church of <hi>Thor,</hi> he ſaw the trees budding, and the graſs coming up green out of the ground, and within a fortnight after he ſaw the Plants full blown, and the leaves of the trees at their perfection, as if they had known how ſhort the Summer was to be, and therefore made ſuch haſt to enjoy it. Their ſoil is generally neither very fertile nor barren, but between both, full of flints, ſtones and rocks, every where appearing high, by whoſe unevenneſs and roughneſs the reſt of the ground about is uſeleſs. The ground is generally very ſoft and ſlabby, by reaſon of the many Lakes and Rivers overſlowing, yet would it be ſit either for tillage or paſture if any would be at the pains and charge of draining it. <hi>Ol. Petrus</hi> ſaies of the Southern part, lying under the ſame climate and influence of the Heavens with <hi>Bothnia,</hi> that 'tis as apt to bear any grain as the Weſtern <hi>Bothnia</hi> it ſelf, but this is not without a concurrence and aptitude likewiſe of the ſoil: and he himſelf confeſſes in Chap. 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, that the Land is ſtony, ſandy, uneven, overrun in ſome places with briars and thornes, and in others nothing but hills; moores, fennes and ſtanding waters, which are not the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98689:10"/>that uſually commend Land for agriculture. Then as to his urging its verdant and rich paſtures, it doth not follow that all Land which yields much graſs ſhould be equally capable of bearing good corn. Yet doth the Land af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford plenty of graſs, and that ſo good that their Cattel are fatned much cheaper and ſooner with it than any other thing, as alſo divers hearbs, but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly 'tis happy in all kind of pot-hearbs. There are many large Woods and Foreſts, eſpecially towards <hi>Norway,</hi> but not very thick; likewiſe ſteep rocks and high mountaines called <hi>Doffrini;</hi> upon whoſe naked tops, by reaſon of the violence of the winds to which they are expoſed, never yet grew tree. Below theſe hills lie moſt pleaſant Vallies, in which are clear fountaines and rivulets innumerable, which emtying themſelves into the rivers, at length are carried into the <hi>Bothnic</hi> Sea. Their water is clear, ſweet and wholeſome, only their Foreſts abound with ſtinking and ſtanding Pools. This Country Winter and Summer hath an incredible number of all kinds of wild beaſts, eſpecially the leſſer ſorts, which ſuffice not only for their own uſe, but to drive a great trade with their neighbours. They have Birds alſo of all ſorts very many, but Fiſh in ſuch abundance that a great part of the Natives are entirely fed by them. But of all theſe we ſhall ſpeak in their proper places, I will add no more here but this, that the Deſcription of old <hi>Finland</hi> or <hi>Scritofinnia</hi> by the Ancients is the ſame which hath bin given here of <hi>Lapland;</hi> to confirm what I ſaid before that theſe Countries differ only in name, and not in nature and ſituation. We come now to its Diviſion.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Diviſion of <hi>Lapland.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THoSE who have writ of <hi>Lapland,</hi> mention diſſerent diviſions of it. <hi>Saxo</hi> in his 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book, and elſwhere, ſpeaks of two <hi>Laplands,</hi> and after him <hi>Johannes Magnus</hi> tells us, <hi>that both the</hi> Laplands <hi>are joined together South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> I ſuppoſe in that diviſion they had reſpect to their ſituation, and meant the Eaſtern and the Weſtern <hi>Lapland:</hi> for ſo <hi>Damianus Goes,</hi> who ſeems to borrow from <hi>Joh. Magnus,</hi> expreſſes it. <hi>Lapland,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is divided into the Eaſtern and the Western, ſeparated from each other by the Bothnic Sea.</hi> From whence we may gather that that part of the Country which lies on one ſide of the <hi>Bothnia,</hi> was called the Eaſtern <hi>Lapland,</hi> and that which lies on the other, the Weſtern.</p>
               <p>Beſides this diviſion of <hi>Lapland,</hi> there is another taken from the places moſt frequented by the Inhabitants. For one part thereof, lying along the Coaſts of the Ocean, is from thence called <hi>Sioefindmarken,</hi> that is <hi>the maritime Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> the other lying higher on the Continent, <hi>Fioeldmarken,</hi> that is, <hi>inland Lapland:</hi> tho by ſome they are called ſimply <hi>Findmarken</hi> and <hi>Lappmarken.</hi> This laſt diviſion <hi>Pet. Claud</hi> gives us in his 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter. <hi>All the Sea Coasts,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Northward and Eastward as far as</hi> Findmarkia <hi>reaches, are poſſeſt by the</hi> Siaefinni, <hi>or maritime Finlanders, but the mountainous and champaign Country, by the Lapfinni, from thence named Lapmarkia or Wildfindlandia, that is wild or ſavage Findland.</hi> Where he calls one part of the Country <hi>Lapmarckia,</hi> the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98689:11"/>other <hi>Findmarckia,</hi> the one lying along the ſhore, and bordering on the Sea, the other mountainous, woody, and ſavage, upon the <hi>Terra firma.</hi> And this too may be worth our notice, that <hi>Wildfinland</hi> with him is that which others call <hi>Lappmarkia:</hi> I ſuppoſe, becauſe the Natives live by hunting, as thoſe of the other do by fiſhing. For he preſently adds, <hi>There are many thouſands in that place that feed on nothing but the fleſh of wild Beaſts.</hi> And indeed ſome there are with whom thoſe only paſs for the true <hi>Laplanders:</hi> as <hi>Samuel Rheen,</hi> who in his 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Chapter of his forementioned Book, tells us, <hi>that beſides the Scrickfinni</hi> (ſo he calls them that with <hi>Pet. Claud.</hi> are <hi>Sioefinnes</hi>) <hi>there are other true</hi> Laplanders, <hi>that live on nothing but rain deer.</hi> And ſo from the Natives feeding on wild Beaſts, <hi>Lapland</hi> properly ſo called, is alſo ſtiled <hi>Wildfindland,</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Findmarkia,</hi> whoſe Inhabitants live both on Fiſh and Cattel. And yet there may be given another reaſon for the impoſition of this name, from the many woods of that Country. <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> in more places then one calls the natives, men that dwell in woods, or <hi>Savages:</hi> as in the title of his 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Chapt. of his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book, which is, <hi>Concerning the fierceneſs of the</hi> Savages, <hi>or thoſe that dwell in woods,</hi> in which Chapter he deſcribes the <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers.</hi> And in the following Chapter he ſays, <hi>that the wild</hi> Laplanders <hi>are clothed with rich skins of ſeveral Beaſts.</hi> The Baron <hi>Herberſtenius</hi> alſo in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> calls them <hi>Savage Laplanders, who tho they dwell,</hi> ſays he, <hi>on the Sea Coaſt in little Cottages, and lead a brutiſh kind of life, are yet more civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed then the Savages of Lapland:</hi> whence 'tis plain, that by the <hi>Findlanders</hi> living near the Sea, he means thoſe that others call <hi>Sioefinnes,</hi> and by the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage Laplanders</hi> thoſe that poſſeſs the inland Country, who he thinks were ſo called from their wildneſs and barbarity. And by and by he adds, <hi>that by converſe with Strangers, who come thither to trade, they begin to lay aſide their Savage nature, and become a little more civilized.</hi> Afterwards he calls them <hi>Diki Loppi,</hi> which name the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> give them at this time, as hath been ſhewed elſwhere.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Diviſion of <hi>Lapland,</hi> that reſpects the ſeveral Princes to whom the Country is in ſubjection. And this <hi>Andr. Buraeus</hi> intends, when he tells us, <hi>The greatest part of</hi> Lapland, viz. <hi>the Southern and inland Country, belongs all to the Kingdom of Sweden: The maritime tract, that lies on the Ocean, and is called Findmark (whoſe Inhabitants the</hi> Sioefinni, <hi>or maritime Findlanders, are ſo named from their living by fiſhing</hi>) <hi>to Norway: The reſt of them that dwell from the</hi> Caſtle of Warhuus <hi>to the mouth of the</hi> white Sea, <hi>are ſubject to the Ruſſians; which part the Swedes call Trennes, the Natives Pyhinienni, and the Ruſſians Tarchana voloch.</hi> Of their ſubjection to theſe ſeverall Princes, we ſhall ſpeak when we come to treat of their Government; and alſo of thoſe parts that belong to <hi>Norway</hi> or <hi>Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Ruſſia.</hi> At preſent we ſhall only mention the diviſion of that part which is under the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and is named by <hi>Buraeus,</hi> the Southern and inland <hi>Lapland,</hi> and by <hi>Petr. Claud. Lapp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markia</hi> properly ſo called. This is divided into ſix leſſer parts called <hi>marker,</hi> or <hi>lands,</hi> tho <hi>Buraeus</hi> chuſes to render them Territories or Provinces. Each of theſe have their diſtinct names, and are called <hi>Aongermandlandslapmark, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>malappmark, Pithalappmark, Lulalapmark, Tornalapmark, Kiemilapmark.</hi> So <hi>Samuel Rheen</hi> in his firſt Chapter, <hi>That part of</hi> Lapland <hi>which belongs to Sweden is divided into the Kiemenſian, Tornenſian, Lulenſian, Pithenſian, Umenſian, and Angermanlandenſian Lapmark. Buraeus</hi> mentions but five of theſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98689:11"/>Provinces, viz. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>malappmark, Pithalappmark, Lulalapmark, Tornelapmark,</hi> and <hi>Kimilapmark,</hi> comprehending <hi>Angermandlandslapmark</hi> under <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>malapmark,</hi> not that they are one and the ſame Province, but becauſe they are both go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by one Lieutenant. Each of theſe Provinces take their name from Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that run thro the midſt of them, as <hi>Wexionius</hi> in his deſcription of <hi>Swed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> aſſures us. As for their ſituation, <hi>Angermanlandslapmark</hi> borders upon <hi>Andermannia</hi> and <hi>Jemtia,</hi> to this joins <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>malapmark,</hi> next to that is <hi>Pitha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapmark,</hi> and then <hi>Lulelapmark,</hi> all of them lying Weſtward, reaching on one ſide to that ridg of Hills that divides <hi>Swedland</hi> from <hi>Norway,</hi> and on the other ſide to the Weſtern <hi>Bothnia.</hi> Northward of them lies <hi>Tornelapmark,</hi> and extends it ſelf from the fartheh corner of the <hi>Bay of Bothnia</hi> all along the North Sea, called by Seamen <hi>Cape Noort.</hi> Next to this lies <hi>Kimilapmark,</hi> winding from the North toward the Eaſt, and bounded on one ſide by the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern <hi>Bothnia,</hi> on another ſide by that part of <hi>Lapland</hi> that belongs to <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> and on a third ſide by <hi>Cajania</hi> and <hi>Carelia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover theſe Provinces we are ſpeaking of, are ſubdivided into leſſer parts, called by the <hi>Swedes Byar,</hi> as <hi>Samuel Rheen</hi> tells us, and are equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to our <hi>Shires,</hi> and the <hi>Pagi</hi> of the Ancients. So in <hi>Caeſar</hi> we meet with <hi>Pagus Tigurinus,</hi> and <hi>Pagi Suevorum,</hi> which were not Villages or Country Towns, but large parts of a Country, ſuch as the <hi>Greeks</hi> called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, uſed in ancient times in the diviſion of Aegypt. Hence the <hi>Gloſſary</hi> renders the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Toparchiae, Pagus,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. There are ſeveral of theſe <hi>Pagi</hi> or <hi>Shires</hi> in each Province, except <hi>Angermanlandslapmark,</hi> which makes but one <hi>Pagus,</hi> vulgarly called <hi>Aoſahla. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>malapmark</hi> hath four, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ma, Lais</hi> or <hi>Raanby, Granby,</hi> and <hi>Vapſteen. Pithalapmark</hi> ſeven, <hi>Graotreskby, Arfwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jerfsby, Lochteby, Arrieplogsby, Wiſierfby, Norrveſterby, Weſterby.

In every <hi>Biar</hi> there are as many allotments as there are families that can live of themſelves, and are not forced by poverty to ſerve others. In the <hi>Byar</hi> called <hi>Aoſahla</hi> there are about 30 of theſe <hi>Clans,</hi> or families, in others more or leſs according as they are in big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which all have their ſeveral names, tho 'tis not worth while to repeat them. And thus much ſhall ſuffice of the third diviſion of <hi>Lapland,</hi> not lately made (except that under <hi>Charles IX</hi> ſome <hi>Clans</hi> had certain allotments aſſign'd them) but derived from very ancient time; as appears from hence that neither the <hi>Laplanders</hi> have known, nor the <hi>Swedes</hi> given them any other, ſince the Country hath bin under their ſubjection. Nor are the words modern, or taken from any thing that may give any cauſe to ſuſpect them of novelty: which I the rather obſerve, that from hence the native ſimplicity, agreable to the antiquity of the Nation, may appear.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the <hi>Laplanders</hi> in reference to the inclinations, temper and habit, of their minds and bodies.</head>
               <p>IT is almoſt peculiar to this People to be all of them of low ſtature, which is atteſted by the general ſuffrage of thoſe Writers who have deſcribed this Country. Hence the learned <hi>Iſaac Voſſius</hi> obſerves, that <hi>Pygmies</hi> are ſaid to inhabit here; and adds that they are a deformed People: but in truth their feature and proportion is good enough, and that they are not diſtorted ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently appears from their great agility of body, and fitneſs for active emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Nor need we diſpute of this, ſince in <hi>Sweden,</hi> we ſee them every day among us, and can obſerve no defect in any kind, or deformity, by <hi>Lomenius</hi> unjuſtly aſcribed to them. <hi>Ol. Mag.</hi> and <hi>Tornaeus</hi> eſteem their young women in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently handſome, and of a clear skin, which I have often ſeen my ſelf; for they take great care to preſerve their natural beauty, which the men ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect to do: and therefore if they are leſs amiable then the other Sex, it is to be imputed to their choice, not nature. To which we may add the length of their froſts, and the bitterneſs of the Air, againſt which they neither arm themſelves ſufficiently with clothes, nor know how to do ſo: beſides the ſmoak which continually fills their cottages empairs very much their natural comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion, which is the reaſon why moſt of the men alſo are ſo ſwarthy. And as they are generally ſhort, they are alſo very lean, and 'tis rare to ſee a fat man amongſt them, for the cold that prevents their growing tall, dries up like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe their moiſture, and makes them apt to be ſlender. They are alſo very light in reſpect of their bulk and ſtature, which comes from their not eating any Salt, if we will believe <hi>Ol. Petr.</hi> And thus much may be ſaid in general of the frame and condition of their bodies. As for their particular parts they have thick heads, prominent foreheads, hollow and blear eyes, ſhort flat noſes, and wide mouths. Their hair is thin, ſhort and flaggy, their beard ſtragling, and ſcarce covers their chins. The hair of both Sexes is generally black and hard, very ſeldom yellow, their breaſts broad, ſlender waſts, ſpindle ſhanks, and ſwift of foot. They are very ſtrong in their limbs, ſo that in a bow which a <hi>Norwegian</hi> can ſcarce half bend, they will draw an arrow up to the head. Their ſtrength is accompanied with ſuch activity withall, that with their bows and quivers at their backs they will throw themſelves thro a hoop of but a cubit in diameter. But this ſeems to be ſpoken only of ſome Tumblers, for the People are generally ignorant of ſuch ſports; their uſual exerciſes being running races, climbing inacceſſible rocks and high trees. Tho they are thus nimble and ſtrong, yet they never go upright, but ſtooping, which habit they get by frequent ſitting in their cottages on the ground.</p>
               <p>We come now to the habits of their mind, in which 'tis firſt obſervable that they are much given to ſuperſtition, which is no wonder while they live in Woods among wild Beaſts, and maintain little correſpondence one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: but of their ſuperſtition we ſhall treat elſwhere. Furthermore they are
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98689:12"/>beyond all imagination fearfull and mean ſpirited, being frighted at the very ſight of a ſtrange man, or ſhip; above all things dreading War: the reaſon of all this being the cold to which they are condemn'd, and the meanneſs of their diet, which cannot ſupply good blood and ſpirits; wherefore they are uſeleſs in war, and the <hi>Swedes</hi> who raiſe men in all the other Provinces, find none in this, as it appears from the ancient Records and Catalogues of all the Souldiers that ever were liſted by former Kings. So that 'tis ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and rather an abuſe than hiſtory, which ſome have reported, that <hi>Guſt. Adolphus</hi> had ſeveral Companies of <hi>Laplanders</hi> in his Armies; but they were forc't to find out ſome excuſe for thoſe many defeats, which to the wonder of the World that moſt victorious Prince gave his powerfull and numerous Enemies; and pretend that thoſe Victories were obtained by the help of the <hi>Laplanders</hi> and Magic. Wherefore I conclude as I ſaid before, that this opinion is abſurd and contradictory, not only to the nature of the People, but to public teſtimonies and writings. To which we may add that they cannot well live out of their own Country, but fall into diſeaſes and die, being no more able to endure a milder air, or feed upon ſalt, bread, and boiled meats, than we could upon their raw fleſh and fiſh dried by the Sun: for it has bin often found by experience that they are hardly temted by any reward to come even into theſe parts, or if they do they die ſuddenly afterwards, much leſs would they be induced to march into any more remote Countries. <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> gives us an inſtance of ſix <hi>Rain-deers</hi> ſent to <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatia</hi> by <hi>Steno Sture</hi> junior Prince of <hi>Swedland,</hi> with two <hi>Laplanders,</hi> a man and woman to be their keepers, and that both they and the beaſts wanting their accuſtom'd manner of living, died all together in a ſhort time. <hi>Ziegler</hi> indeed on the other ſide ſaies they are a valiant People, and that they were a long time free, reſiſting the Arms both of <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Swedland;</hi> and <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> after him ſaies that againſt their enemies they were couragious: and <hi>Petr. Claud.</hi> reports they had a King of their own called <hi>Motle,</hi> and that <hi>Haraldus Pulcricomus,</hi> tho he had conquered the Countries round about, could not ſubdue them; but all this doth not evince their courage: for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is ſaid of this Prince <hi>Motle</hi> is nothing at all to the purpoſe, being all taken out of the hiſtory of <hi>Snorro,</hi> which ſpeaking of <hi>Motle,</hi> and ſomething of his skill in Magick, has not a word of his or his Peoples courage. And 'tis manifeſt that <hi>Ziegler</hi> could have no ground for what he ſaid, unleſs from ſuch hiſtories as that of <hi>Snorro,</hi> which therefore only ſeem'd true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there were none extant more likely; for in his time the <hi>Laplanders</hi> were ſubject to the <hi>Swedes:</hi> unleſs we had rather believe that he took the <hi>Laplanders</hi> and the <hi>Biarmians</hi> to be the ſame, aſcribing to the one People, what was ſaid of the other. There is indeed mention in <hi>Saxo,</hi> of ſeverall Wars of the <hi>Biar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians,</hi> but thoſe not managed by courage, but Magick and Enchantments: ſo that it no way follows, that becauſe they continued for many Ages a free People, that therefore they were valiant. But whatever becomes of the <hi>Biar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians,</hi> 'tis ſure enough that the <hi>Laplanders</hi> are far from being ſtout or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, who muſt firſt fight againſt their nature, before they can reſiſt an enemy. Beſides their innate cowardiſe, they are ſtrangely prone to ſuſpicion and jealouſy, being conſcious of their own weakneſs, and ſo expoſed to all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temts upon them: a conſequent whereof is that they are alſo revengefull; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to prevent thoſe miſcheifs which upon the ſlighteſt occaſions ſeem to threaten them, by the death and ruine of the Perſons that cauſed their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98689:13"/>ſuſpicion, helping themſelves herein, by conjuration and magick. Of this <hi>Pet. Claud.</hi> gives us a memorable inſtance, in one, that having attemted to miſcheif his enemy, who was ſecured by countercharms, after long attendance ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd him aſleep under a great ſtone, which by a ſpell he made break to pieces, and kill him. The women, eſpecially when grown old, cannot brook any ſuddain provocation, but upon the leaſt indignity offered fly out into paſſion, and are hurried to the moſt wild tranſports that madneſs can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate. The <hi>Laplanders</hi> beſides are very notorious cheats, and induſtrious to over-reach each other in bargaining: tho heretofore they had the reputation of plain dealing and honeſty. So that 'tis probable that they took up their preſent practice, having bin firſt cheated by thoſe Strangers with whom they dealt, and now think it beſt to be before hand with one another. It is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſervable that they take great pleſure, if they happen to outwit any one; imagining that tho they are hopeleſs to overcome by manhood and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, they have a nobler triumph over the minds of thoſe whom they cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvent. They are alſo noted to be of a cenſorious and detracting humor, ſo as to make it a chief ingredient of their familiar converſe, to reproch and deſpiſe others: and this they do eſpecially to Strangers, of what Country ſoever. So fond admirers are all men of themſelves, that even the <hi>Laplanders</hi> will not exchange their intereſts with the Inhabitants of the moſt happy Climate, and however barbarous they are, doubt not to prefer themſelves in point of wiſdom, to thoſe that are moſt ingenuouſly educated in Arts and Letters. They are likewiſe exceedingly covetous, it being a part of their cowardize to dread poverty; yet are they very lazy withall: and hereupon <hi>Olaus Peters</hi> obſerves, that tho their Country in ſeveral parts of it be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of emprovement by husbandry, yet 'tis ſuffer'd to lye waſt: nay ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing are they to take pains, that till they are compelled by neceſſity, they hardly perſwade themſelves to hunt or fiſh. From this their covetouſneſs and ſloth ariſes an ill conſequent, their undutifulneſs to their Parents when grown old; not only to contemn and neglect, but even hate and abhor them; thinking it either long before they poſſeſs what they have, or thinking it grievous to provide for thoſe from whom they can hope for no advantage.</p>
               <p>Their laſt good quality is their immoderate luſt, which <hi>Herberstein</hi> takes to be the more ſtrange, conſidering their diet, that they have neither bread nor ſalt, nor any other incentive of gluttony: but their promiſcuous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual lying together in the ſame Hut, without any difference of age, ſex, or condition, ſeems to occaſion this effect. <hi>Tornaeus</hi> indeed ſaies of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, the <hi>Lappi Tornenſes,</hi> who poſſibly are reclaimed by more civill edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that they are very chaſt, inſomuch that among them ſcarce one ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard is Chriſtned in a whole year, which is the leſs to be wonder'd at, the women being naturally barren.</p>
               <p>Having given this account of the <hi>Laplanders</hi> ill qualities, it will now be juſtice to recount their vertues, as firſt their veneration and due eſteem of Marriage, which they more ſeldom violate, then many who pretend to be much better Chriſtians. They alſo abhor theft; ſo that the Merchants only cover their goods ſo as to ſecure them againſt the weather, when they have occaſion to leave them, and at their return are ſure to find them ſafe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toucht; which is the more commendable, for that in <hi>Lapland</hi> there are no Towns, or ſtore-houſes, and no man could be ſure of any thing, if the People were inclined to thievery. They are likewiſe (thoſe I mean of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98689:13"/>better ſort) charitable to the poor, not only by receiving thoſe that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute into their Huts; but ſupplying them with ſtock whereon to live. In proof of this <hi>Tornaeus</hi> and <hi>Sam. Rheen,</hi> ſay that 'tis uſual with them to lend <hi>gratis,</hi> for a conſiderable time, ten or twenty Rain-deers. Farther they are civil and hoſpitable to Strangers, whom they with much kindneſs invite to their Huts, and there treat with the beſt proviſions they have. And of this there are ſeverall inſtances, when any have happened to be caſt upon their Coaſt by ſhipwrack, or elſe in the ſnow, or on the mountains have loſt their way. Moreover they are thus far cleanly as often to waſh their hands and face; tho notwithſtanding <hi>Tornaeus</hi> tells us, they are naſty and ſcabby, and uſe not to comb their heads. Laſtly they are ſufficiently ingenious, making for themſelves all ſorts of tools and implements for their fiſhing and hunting; and alſo for ſeverall manufactures, ſome of which they do very artificially, as ſhall be ſhewn hereafter in its proper place.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the Originall of the <hi>Laplanders.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WE have intimated our conjecture concerning the originall of the <hi>Laps,</hi> and more then that it will be hard to produce, there being no ſober hiſtory which gives teſtimony in this affair. Negatively we may paſs ſentence, and conclude they were not <hi>Swedes,</hi> no People differing more both in conſtitution of body and mind, in language and habit, or whatever elſe is taken for a character of likeneſs, or having the ſame originall. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any one think that they were ever <hi>Ruſſians</hi> or <hi>Moſcovites;</hi> ſeeing they differ as much from them, as from the <hi>Swedes.</hi> The <hi>Ruſſians</hi> are generally tall, the <hi>Laplanders</hi> on the contrary very ſhort; thoſe are fat and corpulent, theſe lean and ſlender; thoſe have thick hair, long beards, and good complexions, theſe wear their hair ſhort and thin, and are dark and ſwarthy. But moſt of all the language is different, in which the <hi>Laps</hi> and <hi>Ruſſes</hi> have in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner no kind of agreement. They muſt then come from their Neighbours, either the <hi>Norwegians</hi> on the one ſide, or the <hi>Finlanders</hi> upon the other. But they could not well be derived from <hi>Norway,</hi> who are known to have drawn their originall from the <hi>Swedes.</hi>
               </p>

                  <figDesc>depiction of a man holding a spear</figDesc>
               </figure>
               <p>But here ſome imagine that the <hi>Laplanders</hi> came not in probability from the <hi>Finlanders,</hi> becauſe the one are very warlike, the other cowards, theſe fat and corpulent, thoſe lean and meager. But this doth not at all inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate our arguments; for every one knows that diet will much alter the habit of the body, and the <hi>Finlanders</hi> have plenty of good nuriſhing meats, of which the <hi>Laplanders</hi> are quite deſtitute. And for the <hi>Finlanders</hi> courage in war, heretofore they were not ſo notable for it, for <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaies <hi>they had neither arms nor horſes,</hi> by which he implies they knew not at all what belonged to war. Neither are they very expert at it yet, for by daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience 'tis found when they are likely to be preſt for Soldiers they hide themſelves, and by all means decline employment, therefore they are not warlike from their nature, but from their diſcipline and arts, and in their natural temper they differ not much from the <hi>Laplanders.</hi> But what need we go about to prove this by ſo many arguments, when they confeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they are originally ſprung from the <hi>Finlanders,</hi> and ſtill keep a liſt of the Captains that firſt led them forth into <hi>Lapland,</hi> of whom <hi>Mieſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gieſch</hi> is the chief. The ſame is confirm'd by <hi>Andr. Andreſonius</hi> who lived there, and learn't it from them, only that he ſaid <hi>Thins kogreh</hi> was the cheif Captain, and ſo doth <hi>Zachar. Plantin.</hi> But whatever is ſaid of either of theſe two Captains, we are not to imagine that they brought the firſt Plantation of <hi>Laplanders</hi> into this Country, for 'tis not probable they ſhould ſo long remember their names, who muſt have lived before <hi>Saxo,</hi> for he mentions this Country, and lived about 480 years before us, at which time the <hi>Finlanders</hi> themſelves ſcarce know what was done, much leſs the <hi>Laplanders.</hi> And this the name <hi>Thinns,</hi> doth ſomething prove, which none ſhall perſwade me to be an old <hi>Finland</hi> word, for it is the ſame with the <hi>Swedes Thinnis,</hi> and the Dutch <hi>Thinius,</hi> i. e. <hi>Antonius,</hi> and that the word <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> was known to the <hi>Finlanders</hi> before <hi>Chriſt</hi> no man will ſuſpect. The ſame may be ſaid concerning the pretended occaſion of the Colony of <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> ſetling in <hi>Lapland;</hi> for they themſelves ſay, that they left <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>karla</hi> and <hi>Rengoarvis,</hi> becauſe they were oppreſt with taxes and pitcht firſt in a wood in <hi>Ostrobothnia</hi> called <hi>Tavaſtia</hi> near the <hi>Bodic bay.</hi> But all this, as hath bin ſhew'd the very name of <hi>Lappi,</hi> which ſignifies baniſh't perſons, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently confutes. <hi>Plantin</hi> and <hi>Peter Nieuren,</hi> pretend that though the <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> voluntarily removed to <hi>Tavaſtia,</hi> they were forc't to their preſent habitation: for the Natives of <hi>Tavaſtia,</hi> griev'd to ſee them in a floriſhing condition, wearing rich clothes, fareing deliciouſly, and abounding in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wealth, choſe them a Captain called <hi>Matthias Kurk,</hi> and with a great number invaded their quarters, killing and plundering all they met with, nor deſiſting till they had quite drove them as far as the Rivers <hi>Kimi</hi> and <hi>Torne:</hi> and not long after perceiving they lived too happily there, they ſet upon
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98689:15"/>them the ſecond time, dealing ſo cruelly with them, that leaving their Cattel they were forc't to fly into thoſe barren Countries they now inhabit, carrying with them only their nets. <hi>Plantin.</hi> adds further that <hi>Andr. Andreſonius</hi> affirms he ſaw ſome ancient letters, in which mention was made of <hi>Kurk</hi> a Governour of the <hi>Laplanders:</hi> but as for his other name of <hi>Matthias,</hi> it is plain it was poſtnate to Chriſtianity, ſince which time if we ſhould imagine the <hi>Laplanders</hi> firſt to have come into theſe parts, we muſt alſo ſuppoſe the Country to have bin till then uninhabited, whereas we have all reaſon to believe that the <hi>Biar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi</hi> and <hi>Scridfinni</hi> lived here before <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the latter of which ſeem by their name to have bin only a Colony ſent out of <hi>Finland:</hi> and mention is made of <hi>Finlanders</hi> in theſe parts in the time of <hi>Harald</hi> the fair, or <hi>Harfager</hi> King of <hi>Norway,</hi> and his Son <hi>Ericus Bodſexe,</hi> who lived long before the times of Chriſtianity, and went down into <hi>Finmark</hi> and <hi>Biarmia,</hi> and obtained a great victory over them. Now if he went by Sea Northwards of <hi>Norway</hi> to come to <hi>Finmark, Finmark</hi> then muſt have bin near <hi>Norway,</hi> as lying North of it near the Sea, that is the ſame Country that is now named <hi>Finmark,</hi> which becauſe then inhabited by <hi>Finlanders,</hi> as appears by the name, it is not to be believed that it was firſt poſſeſs't by the <hi>Laplanders</hi> that were drove out of <hi>South-Bothnia</hi> by <hi>Matthias Kurk.</hi> Neither are they called <hi>Lappi</hi> from being driven out then, for they were ſo called in <hi>Saxo</hi>'s time, and there is little reaſon to believe that <hi>Matthias Kurk</hi>'s expedition was before him, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from that inſcription which mentions <hi>Kurk,</hi> ſince that in thoſe times they knew not ſo much of writing as to record any thing in it.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we muſt find out ſome better authority to confirm to us the originall of the <hi>Lapps,</hi> for we may believe that the <hi>Finlanders</hi> more then once march't out into <hi>Lapland,</hi> which is evident from the ſeveral names of their leaders, whom ſome called <hi>Thinns-Kogre,</hi> others <hi>Mieſchogieſche.</hi> The firſt and moſt ancient is that from whence the <hi>Biarmi</hi> took their originall, whom I conclude to have deſcended from the <hi>Finlanders,</hi> from calling their Gods by <hi>Finlandiſh</hi> names. Beſides in their nature and manners they agree with the ancient <hi>Finlanders:</hi> and laſtly are called by all Strangers <hi>Scridfinni,</hi> i. e. <hi>Finlanders</hi> going upon frozen ſnow, which, the ancient knowing none elſe to go ſo, took to be the <hi>Biarmi.</hi> But the name of <hi>Biarmi</hi> was given them by the <hi>Finlanders</hi> from their going to dwell upon the Mountains, from the word <hi>Varama,</hi> which ſignifies a hilly Country: now becauſe Strangers knew from the <hi>Swedes</hi> they uſed wooden ſhoes to go upon the ſnow, which by the <hi>Swedes</hi> are called <hi>Att Skrlida,</hi> not knowing the name <hi>Biarmi,</hi> they called them <hi>Scridfinni:</hi> and becauſe the <hi>Finlanders</hi> and <hi>Biarmians</hi> were of the ſame originall, they were often ſubject to the ſame Prince, as to <hi>Cuſo</hi> in King <hi>Holters</hi> time. What the occaſion was of this leaving their Country is yet doubtfull, except it was for fear of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who in the reign of King <hi>Agnus</hi> invaded <hi>Froſte</hi> King of <hi>Finland,</hi> and haraſſed the whole Country. The ſecond time of deſerting their Country was when the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged their Empire as far as the lake <hi>Ladog.</hi> For fearing the cruelty of theſe People they retired into <hi>Lapland:</hi> which I am apt to beleive becauſe the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> call them <hi>Kienni,</hi> as has bin ſaid before from their paſſage through <hi>Kajania</hi> into <hi>Lapland,</hi> which they could not have known but by their own experience; and their wars with them, eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Carelia</hi> and <hi>Cajania</hi> being ſo ignorant both in hiſtory and other Countries, that they ſcarce know any thing of their own, that is of any antiquity. And this proves what we
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98689:15"/>ſaid of their ſecond leaving their Country, which was about the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> age after <hi>Christ:</hi> and theſe perhaps are they which are ſimply called <hi>Finni</hi> by the <hi>Danes, Swedes,</hi> and <hi>Norwegians,</hi> or with the addition of <hi>Siae</hi> or <hi>Field,</hi> obſolete words of the <hi>Biarmians,</hi> becauſe they were more then they in number, eſpecially after <hi>Harald Harfiger</hi> King of <hi>Norway,</hi> who almoſt deſtroyed all the <hi>Biarmi</hi> in battle. In the mean while the <hi>Finlanders</hi> lay ſecure in <hi>Finmark,</hi> and all the <hi>Biarmi</hi> being extinct, the name of <hi>Finni</hi> obtained, and the name and credit of the <hi>Biarmi</hi> was quite aboliſh't and forgot. And theſe are all the times they left their Country before they were called <hi>Lappi,</hi> for till after this they were never called otherwiſe than <hi>Finni, Scritofinni,</hi> and <hi>Biarmi.</hi> But in after ages we find them named <hi>Lappones,</hi> of whom <hi>Adam. Bremenſis</hi> makes no mention who lived in 1077, but <hi>Saxo</hi> doth, that lived in 1200; and therefore 'tis probable that in that intervall of time, after they were call'd <hi>Lappones,</hi> they made their third migration. But any one that will examine the hiſtories of that time, will ſcarce find any thing that ſhould move the <hi>Finlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> to leave their Country, as <hi>Ericus Sanctus</hi> hath made it appear in that Expedition in which he brought them under the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Government, and planted among them the Chriſtian Religion, which he made in the year 1150, when no ſmall number of them the third time ſeem to have deſerted their Country, and gone into <hi>Lapland.</hi> And the reaſon is plain, having bin ſubject'd to Strangers, and forc't to be of a Religion different from that of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, which thereupon was hatefull to them, and therefore no wonder ſome of them ſought out a place where they might live free: which is as good a reaſon too why they were called <hi>Lapps</hi> by thoſe that ſtayed, for they ſubmitting to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and embracing Chriſtianity, look't upon them as deſertors of their Country, whom fear only of a good Government, and better Religion, had made exiles, eſpecially when the King had put forth an Edict that all ſhould be accounted baniſh't that would not renounce Pagan Superſtition; therefore they were juſtly called <hi>Lappi,</hi> and care not to hear of the name to this day.</p>
               <p>And this is my opinion of their originall and migrations, out of which I ſhall not be perſwaded by thoſe learned men who believe they rather came from the <hi>Tartars,</hi> for we never read of any of them going into the North Moreover the <hi>Tartars</hi> live altogether by war and plunder, whereas the <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> live by hunting and graſing, abhorring nothing more than war. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the cheif delight of the <hi>Tartars</hi> is in having many ſtately Horſes, of which the <hi>Lapps</hi> are ſo ignorant, that in their whole language they have not a word to ſignify an Horſe: the language alſo of the two Nations is ſo different that one cannot poſſibly be derived from the other. And altho ſome learned men, who pretend they underſtood both languages of <hi>Finland</hi> and <hi>Lapland,</hi> conſidently aver that they are altogether diverſe: yet it will be eaſy to produce diverſe men as well skill'd in them, as they that ſay the contrary. Beſides 'tis no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence becauſe there are a few differences between the <hi>Finland</hi> and <hi>Lapland</hi> languages, that they are therefore utterly diverſe, when this diſagreeing may rather proceed from the length of time than any diverſity of the Tongues at firſt, as we find now many <hi>Swediſh</hi> words that do not at all agree with thoſe now in vogue, which yet do not conſtitute a new language. And their ſaying the <hi>Laplanders</hi> could not come from the <hi>Finlanders,</hi> becauſe they alwaies hated one another, is of little force, when the reaſons of their hatred are enough explained already. But it ſignifies leſs that the <hi>Finlanders</hi> have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Cuſtoms and Manners not in uſe among the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> as the way of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98689:16"/>building houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for theſe were to accommodate themſelves to the nature of the place whither they came, and to forget thoſe things which would not be of any uſe to them. And moreover, there remains ſtill a memoriall of thoſe that came out of <hi>Finland,</hi> where they firſt ſate down in the woods of <hi>Tavaſtia,</hi> near a Lake which they call <hi>Lappiakairo,</hi> that is the Fountain of the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> who when their neceſſary food grew ſcarce, went further up into the Deſarts, and the <hi>Finlanders</hi> purſuing them in <hi>Tavastia,</hi> they retreat'd to the <hi>Bothnic</hi> bay, where they might be more ſafe, and have more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences for living: and this is that migration yet in memory which <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin.</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Laplanders</hi> lived here for an age, or more, till the time of King <hi>Magn. Ladulaos,</hi> An. 1272, who to get them under his ſubjection, promiſed any one that could effect it, the Government of them, which the <hi>Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>karli, i. e.</hi> thoſe that lived in the allotment or diviſion of <hi>Birkala,</hi> undertook; and having for a great while cunningly inſinuated themſelves into them, under a pretence of friendſhip, at laſt ſet upon them unawares, and quite ſubdued them. But before this they were infeſted by the <hi>Tavaſti</hi> under the command of <hi>Kurk,</hi> which if we would ſtrictly examine, we ſhould find it of later date than about Chriſts time, contrary to ſome mens opinions. As it happens in things that are taken upon truſt, the <hi>Laplanders</hi> confound the more modern with the ancient, making but one hiſtory of all that happen'd in the diſtinct times of <hi>Ericus Sanctus, Magnus Ladulaos,</hi> with ſome other Kings before and after, and that ſo confuſed and lame, that it is hard for any one to underſtand it. <hi>Ol. Petr.</hi> mentions at large one <hi>Matthias,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Finlanders,</hi> when they ſubdued and drove out the <hi>Laplanders</hi> into the furtheſt and moſt deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late place of the North, whom ſome think to be a noble Family of the <hi>Kurks</hi> in <hi>Finland,</hi> and that he ceaſed not, by frequent inrodes upon them, to moleſt them, till they promiſed to pay him yearly tribute, which he at length weary of the long and tedious journey exchanged with ſome of <hi>Birkarla</hi> in <hi>Tavastia</hi> for a part of <hi>Finland,</hi> whence followed what is moſt true, that the <hi>Laplanders</hi> to the year 1554 paid annuall tribute to the <hi>Birkarli,</hi> beſides whom it was not lawfull for any others to trade with them. There are thoſe now living who ſay they have ſeen the letters and conditions of the <hi>Kurks</hi> kept in <hi>Erſnees,</hi> an allotment of <hi>Lulalapmark,</hi> by one <hi>Jo. Nilſon.</hi> Which things are ſo far from being immediatly after the birth of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that they may be reaſonably thought to have bin ſince <hi>Mag. Ladulaos,</hi> unleſs we can imagine that <hi>Ol. Petr.</hi> by his <hi>Tavasti</hi> and <hi>Buraeus</hi> by <hi>Birkarli</hi> meant the ſame people, ſince there were other <hi>Birkarli</hi> inhabitants of <hi>Tavastia,</hi> who choſe them a Captain named <hi>Kurk,</hi> under whom they drove out the <hi>Laplanders</hi> out of the Borders of the Eaſtern <hi>Bothnia,</hi> and made them tributary, and the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters may not be aſcribed to <hi>Kurk,</hi> but to <hi>Ladulaos,</hi> in which he had granted the <hi>Birkarli</hi> the priviledge to receive tribute of the <hi>Lapps,</hi> and of trafficking with them, for it is not probable that <hi>Kurk,</hi> though he was their choſen Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain, was to have all the benefit of the <hi>Laplanders</hi> to himſelf, ſo as by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract to tranfer to the <hi>Birkarli</hi> his right. For the <hi>Tavastii</hi> were either a free Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ſo ſhared among one another whatever they got, or elſe under ſome Prince, and ſo could not give another what was not their own, but their Maſters. Beſides if they did give <hi>Kurk</hi> any thing, as ſome Villages, or the like, it was not from any bargain that they were to receive in its ſtead tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute from the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> but as a reward to himſelf for his pains and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in the war. But whatever may be ſaid of <hi>Kurk</hi> and the <hi>Tavaſti,</hi> 'tis certain
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98689:16"/>the <hi>Laplanders</hi> never came originally from the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> nor as others think from the <hi>Tartars,</hi> but from the <hi>Finlanders,</hi> having bin driven out of their Country, and forc't to change their habitations often, till at length they ſixt in this Land where they now live: and that Country, which from the remove of its inhabitants was called <hi>Lapland,</hi> had the ſame name continued by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who had conquered the greateſt part thereof. For after the <hi>Swedes</hi> had learnt from the <hi>Finlanders</hi> that they were called <hi>Lapps,</hi> they alſo gave them the ſame name, then the <hi>Danes</hi> took it up: then <hi>Saxo,</hi> afterwards <hi>Ziegler,</hi> then <hi>Dam. Goes,</hi> who had the account which he gives of the <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> from <hi>Ol.</hi> and <hi>Joh. Magn.</hi> and ſo at laſt all the Country was called <hi>Lapland</hi> from the Bay of <hi>Bothnia</hi> Northwards, eſpecially after it was made ſubject to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> except only that part which lies on the Coaſts of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> which retained its antient name of <hi>Finland;</hi> as alſo that part towards the white Sea, called by the <hi>Moſcovites, Cajanica,</hi> altho theſe ſometimes call the inhabitants <hi>Loppi,</hi> which without doubt they took from their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours the <hi>Finlanders.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the Religion of the <hi>Laplanders.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HAVING ſeen the riſe and Original of the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> we come now to ſpeak more diſtinctly of them, but firſt of their Religion; not only what is now, but alſo what was before Chriſtianity came to be receiv'd there. For there were <hi>Laplanders,</hi> or at leaſt ſome Inhabitants of <hi>Lapland</hi> before the Chriſtian Religion was introduced: ſuch as the <hi>Finni, Lappofinni, Scrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finni,</hi> or <hi>Biarmi,</hi> as is above ſaid; but it was very long before the <hi>Laplanders</hi> properly ſo called embraced the Chriſtian Religion. At firſt there is no doubt they were Pagans, as all the Northern Nations were, but being all Pagans were not of the ſame Religion, it may be enquired which the <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> profeſt. And I ſuppoſe it could be no other then that of the <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> from whom they derive their original, and conſequently their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion too. But what the Religion of the <hi>Finlanders</hi> was is very uncertain, ſince we have no account of the ancient affairs of that Nation. Therefore we muſt make our conjectures from the <hi>Biarmi,</hi> and <hi>Scridfinni,</hi> as alſo from ſome remains among the <hi>Finlanders</hi> and <hi>Laplanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have already prov'd the <hi>Biarmi</hi> to be the firſt Colony that the <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> ſent into <hi>Lapland,</hi> of whom this is chiefly recorded in ancient Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, that they worſhip'd a certain God whom they called <hi>Jumala:</hi> which <hi>Jumala</hi> or <hi>Jomala</hi> is manifeſtly a different word from what is mentioned in the Hiſtory of <hi>St. Olaus</hi> King of <hi>Norway,</hi> and of <hi>Herrodus,</hi> for they relate it as peculiar to the <hi>Biarmi,</hi> and unknown to themſelves; who being either <hi>Goths, Norwegians</hi> or <hi>Iſlanders,</hi> it cannot poſſibly be any old <hi>Gothic</hi> word, but of ſome other Country, and therefore moſt probably of <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where it is now in uſe. For <hi>God,</hi> which is by the <hi>Swedes, Goths,</hi> and all of the ſame original termed <hi>Gott,</hi> or <hi>Gudh,</hi> is by them called <hi>Jumala;</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:98689:17"/>cuſtom without doubt prevailing that the ſame name, whereby in ancient times they called the falſe God, was tranſlated to the true One, both by the <hi>Finlanders,</hi> the <hi>Biarmi</hi> and the <hi>Laplanders</hi> alſo who came out of <hi>Finland,</hi> and being joined with the <hi>Biarmi</hi> made one Nation. Beſides <hi>Jumala,</hi> it ſeems the <hi>Laplanders</hi> had a God whom the <hi>Swedes</hi> call <hi>Thor,</hi> which may be gathered, not only becauſe they worſhip one <hi>Thor</hi> at this preſent among their idols, as ſhall be ſhewn hereafter, but alſo becauſe in the number of Gods which the old <hi>Finlanders,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Tavasti</hi> adored, there was reckoned <hi>Turriſas,</hi> the God of War and Victory, which was no other then <hi>Thor.</hi> This <hi>Turriſas</hi> is put in one word for <hi>Turris-As</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Turris, Turrus,</hi> or <hi>Torus</hi> (for ſo his name is diverſly written) the Prince of the <hi>Aſes,</hi> or <hi>Aſiatics,</hi> for thoſe who in former times came out of <hi>Aſia</hi> into theſe parts were called <hi>Aſes,</hi> of whom this <hi>Turrus</hi> was the firſt, who from that time was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped by the <hi>Finlanders</hi> by the name of <hi>Turriſas;</hi> which may farther be proved from <hi>Arngrinus Jonae,</hi> who ſaies the firſt King of the <hi>Finlanders</hi> was <hi>Torrus,</hi> one of the Predeceſſors of King <hi>Norus,</hi> from whom ſome think <hi>Norige,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Norway,</hi> quaſi <hi>Nori Rige,</hi> to take its denomination, it being frequent for the ancient Kings to take upon them the names of their Gods. Thus among the ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> we find many who were called by the names of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Neptune.</hi> So <hi>Torrus</hi> the King was ſo called from <hi>Torus</hi> the ancient God of the <hi>Finlanders,</hi> from whom without doubt he was derived to the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> together with their language, worſhips, and other cuſtoms. To theſe two (if they are two) <hi>Jumala</hi> and <hi>Thor,</hi> may be added the <hi>Sun,</hi> which I gather from this, becauſe he is ſtill reckoned among their Gods. Beſides he is generally worſhip'd in all barbarous and pagan Countries, and if he be adored for his light and heat by thoſe People, who enjoy the benefit of a warm air and temperate climate, how much more by the <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> who for no ſmall ſpace endure the hardſhip of continual night and bitter froſts? but I ſhall ſpeak more concerning the Sun hereafter.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the chief Gods of the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> whether they had any of leſs note may be queſtioned, tho I doubt it not; becauſe at this day they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſome others, which the <hi>Finlanders</hi> did before them, and probably brought with them into <hi>Lapland.</hi> Of theſe the <hi>Carelii</hi> had <hi>Rongotheus</hi> the God of Ry, <hi>Pellonpeko</hi> of Barly, <hi>Wierecannos</hi> of Oats, <hi>Egres</hi> of Herbs, Peaſe, Turnips, Flax, and Homp; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ko</hi> with his wife <hi>Rowne,</hi> of tempeſts; <hi>Kaekre</hi> the Protector of Cattel from wild beaſts; <hi>Hyſe</hi> had the command of <hi>Wolves,</hi> and Bears, <hi>Nyrke</hi> of Squirrel-hunting, <hi>Hyttavanes</hi> of Hare-hunting. Some of theſe the <hi>Laplanders</hi> worſhipped; eſpecially thoſe whoſe help they ſtood chiefly in need of to the performing of their buſineſs, as the gods of hunting and preſerving their Cattel from wild beaſts, and ſuch like: others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably they neglected as uſeleſs, becauſe they neither plowed nor ſowed. But I cannot ſay under what names they worſhipped them, becauſe I find nothing of certainty thereof, either in their ancient records, or modern cuſtoms.</p>
               <p>Next we muſt conſider what kind of worſhip they pai'd their Gods, which we have already mentioned; but of this alſo we are in great uncertainty, unleſs we make our judgment from the preſent times, and deliver thoſe rites which are now uſed by the <hi>Laplanders</hi> in their religious performances, but of this we ſhall ſpeak more when we come to treat of the preſent ſtate of their Religion. We ſhall only note here what is read of <hi>Jumala.</hi> He was
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98689:17"/>heretofore repreſented in the image of a man ſitting upon an Altar, with a Crown on his head, adorned with twelve gems, and a golden Chain about his neck, which was formerly of the value of 300 Marks; tho whether the word in the Hiſtory doth ſignify a chain, or may better be rendred a Jewel, 'tis uncertain; for it is ſaid that <hi>Charles</hi> lifting his Ax, cut the collar whereon it hanged: which ſhews that it was rather gold artificially carved and ſet with jewels, which was (I ſuppoſe) the reaſon why <hi>Herrodus</hi> doth not ſet down its weight, as is uſual in the valuing of chains, but its price. This Jewel called <hi>Men</hi> from <hi>Mene</hi> the Moon whoſe figure it repreſented, was, as I imagine, tied to a collar about the neck, and hanged down upon the breſt of the image, as is uſual in all ſuch ornaments at this day. But whether this were a chain or locket, it is certain the other parts of his habit were agreeable to our deſcription of him; wherein he was not much unlike the <hi>Swedes</hi> God <hi>Thor,</hi> as he is deſcribed in our Hiſtory of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal:</hi> for he alſo was made ſitting with a Crown on his head, adorned with Stars, as <hi>Jumala</hi> with jewels, each to the number of twelve, from whence I am almoſt perſwaded that the <hi>Biarmi,</hi> and after them the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> either worſhipped one God under two names, or if they were two Gods, they uſed their names promiſcuouſly. For the true God, whom they knew partly by reaſon, and partly by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was by them called <hi>Jumala:</hi> but after the name of <hi>Thor</hi> began to be famous, they either called <hi>Jumala</hi> by the name of <hi>Thor,</hi> or gave <hi>Thor</hi> the name of <hi>Jumala:</hi> which I gather from hence, becauſe at this day the <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> attribute that to their <hi>Thor,</hi> which queſtionleſs formerly they did to <hi>Jumala, viz.</hi> the power and command over the inferior Gods, eſpecially the bad and hurtful: alſo over the air, thunder, lightning, health, life and death of men, and ſuch like; as ſhall be ſhewn hereafter. What his image was made of, is not known, but I ſuppoſe it was wood, becauſe <hi>Charles</hi> is ſaid to have cut off his head with his Ax, when he only deſigned the cutting of the collar that held the aforeſaid jewel, which he could hardly have don, had it bin either ſilver or gold. Beſides, to prove it was wood, it was burnt to aſhes, together with the Temple, and all its furniture, excepting ſome gold, and other precious things; with which gold particularly they did ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to their God: for the <hi>Biarmi</hi> in their ceremonies to <hi>Jumala,</hi> did caſt gold as a ſacred offertory to him into a golden diſh, of a vaſt weight and bigneſs, which ſtood upon his knees. This Veſſel, in the Hiſtory of <hi>Olaus,</hi> is ſaid to be of ſilver, and full of ſilver coin, for a little before his time both baſin and gold were loſt, and the <hi>Biarmi</hi> never had an opportunity of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting more. They did not worſhip <hi>Jumala</hi> every where, but in ſome few places, or perhaps only in that one, where in a thick remote wood he had a kind of a Temple, not as they are uſually built with walls and roof, but only a piece of ground fenced as the old Roman Temples were; from hence one might look every way, which could not have bin don had they bin cover'd at the top. As in the form of their Temples, ſo in the ſituation of them they did imitate the ancients, who for the moſt part choſe groves to worſhip their Gods in, and there built their Temples. So much of <hi>Jumala,</hi> and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient manner of worſhipping him amongſt the <hi>Biarmi,</hi> as it is tranſmitted to us by ancient Writers; but of <hi>Thor,</hi> the Sun, and the other Gods, there is nothing read but what belongs to the times of Chriſtianity, and the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition ſtill remaining amongſt them, of which we ſhall ſpeak particularly in the following Chapter.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the ſecond, or Chriſtian Religion of the <hi>Laplanders.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>LAPLAND among other Nations, after a long night of Paganiſm, was enlightned with the Chriſtian Religion: of which I ſhall now ſpeak. In the firſt place we muſt enquire how and when they firſt began to hear'd of Chriſts name: but this will be very difficult, becauſe all Writers are ſilent herein. <hi>Plantin</hi> indeed affirms from their report, that they firſt hear of the Chriſtian Religion in the laſt age; from whence he concludes that they came out of <hi>Finland</hi> before the <hi>Finlanders</hi> were converted. But for all this we can hardly yield our aſſent to him; for it is certain on the contrary that they knew, and ſome of them embraced, the Chriſtian Religion in the time of <hi>Ziegler,</hi> who lived in the very beginning of the precedent age, and was preſent at the deſtruction of <hi>Stockholm</hi> by <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, which he hath very well deſcribed: he affirms that they admited Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity to obtain the favor of their Kings, which cannot be ſpoken of <hi>Chriſtiern,</hi> or his immediate Predeceſſor, but of ſeveral others in former ages. And indeed it is very improbable that ſo many Chriſtian Kings ſhould take no care of propagating their Religion among the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to live in a heatheniſh impiety, without ſo much as ever hearing the name of Chriſt; eſpecially ſince there are Letters of <hi>Ericus</hi> King of <hi>Pomerania</hi> extant, wherein he adviſes the Conſiſtory of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal</hi> that they would ſend Prieſts to inſtruct the <hi>Laplanders;</hi> which <hi>Charles</hi> the IX after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made an argument of his title to <hi>Lapland</hi> againſt his neighbors. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides they had adjoining to them the <hi>Birkarli,</hi> who were either <hi>Finlanders</hi> or <hi>Swedes,</hi> and were converted long before; with theſe they maintained a commerce, and paid them tribute even from the time of <hi>Ladulaus Magnus,</hi> who reign'd four ages ago. Therefore it is falſe what <hi>Plantin</hi> affirms of their being converted in the laſt age; on the contrary I preſume that from the time of <hi>Ladulaus,</hi> there alwaies were ſome in <hi>Lapland</hi> who either were Chriſtians, or pretended to be ſo: for then their Country was ſubdued and made a Province of <hi>Swedland,</hi> and it cannot be doubted but the <hi>Swedes</hi> propagated the Chriſtian Religion together with their dominion in <hi>Lapland.</hi> Tho if our conjecture prove true of the <hi>Laplanders</hi> removing out of <hi>Finland,</hi> by reaſon of the wars of <hi>Ericus Sanctus,</hi> and the planting of the Chriſtian Religion there, it will appear from thence that they heard of Chriſt, tho they neglected him. However no prudent man can ſuppoſe that their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors the <hi>Finlanders</hi> for ſo many ages ſhould never mention any thing of the Chriſtian Religion to them. And therefore my opinion is the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that the <hi>Laplanders</hi> had heard of Chriſt ever ſince <hi>Ericus Sanctus</hi> his time, even theſe five ages, tho they rejected his Doctrine, as long as they retained their own freedom: but after they became ſubject to the <hi>Swedes,</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:98689:18"/>whether on their own accord to pleaſe their Kings, as <hi>Ziegler</hi> would have it, or for other reaſons, at length they took upon them the name of Chriſtians, which happened in the time of <hi>Ladulaus Magnus,</hi> in the year 1277, from whence we muſt date the planting of Chriſtian Religion in <hi>Lapland,</hi> which Religion they neither wholy embraced, nor wholy refuſed, but retained it with an inveterate, and as it were Jewiſh prejudice, not out of any zeal, or preferring it as more neceſſary for their welfare before their former Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but outwardly only and in ſhew, eſteeming it the beſt means to gain their Princes favor, and to prevent thoſe evils which threatened them, if they ſhould perſiſt in their obſtinacy. Hence it was that they were married by a Chriſtian Prieſt, and baptiſed their children according to the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Chriſtianity, which were the two chief things wherein their Chriſtian Religion conſiſted; and the only things mention'd by <hi>Olaus M.</hi> For the uſe of catechiſing, or preaching of the Goſpel, and other information in the heads of Chriſtian Religion were wholy unknown to them, as may be prov'd from the ancient records of Biſhopricks, wherein there is no mention of any <hi>Lapponian</hi> Dioceſs, or Church, or of any Dioceſs to which <hi>Lapland</hi> might belong. Laſtly, if it had not bin ſo, what need was there of <hi>Ericus</hi> his expreſs to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal,</hi> that they would ſend Prieſts into <hi>Lapland?</hi> this, and whatſoever elſe <hi>Ziegler</hi> alledges for the ſlow advance of Chriſtianity in <hi>Lapland, Olaus Magnus</hi> endevors to evade; but at length is forc't to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that the Northern parts thereof are not yet reclaimed, and therefore hopes for their converſion.</p>
               <p>This was the State of Chriſtianity in <hi>Lapland</hi> till the times of <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> differing from their ancient Paganiſm only in name, and a few external rites, whereby they labored to make the World believe that they were Chriſtians, which gave <hi>Damianus à Goes</hi> (tho a friend and contemporary of <hi>Johannes</hi> and <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi>) very good reaſon to complain that there was no knowledg of God and Chriſt in the Land. From hence we may underſtand how to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret <hi>Olaus M.</hi> when he ſaies that by the earneſt and pious exhortations of the Catholic Prieſts, great part of theſe wild People were, and more were likely to be brought over to the Chriſtian Religion. But when <hi>Guſtavus</hi> came to the Crown, as he took greater care then his Predeceſſors for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of the true Religion in other parts of his dominions, ſo he did in <hi>Lapland</hi> alſo; and as the chief means to effect this, he took the peculiar charge of them upon himſelf. Whereas heretofore they were rather tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the <hi>Birkarli</hi> then the Kings of <hi>Sweden;</hi> and conſequently neglected by thoſe Kings; now at ſome ſet times in the Winter, they were obliged to meet together in a place appointed, where they were to pay their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Kings Officers, and be inſtructed in the Goſpel by the Prieſts, and alſo to give an account of what they learnt the year before. This cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom muſt needs have its beginning in <hi>Guſtavus</hi>'s time, for he was the firſt King that demanded tribute of the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> and conſequently that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled them together for the paying of it. Beſides <hi>Olaus M.</hi> mentions no ſuch inſtitution; which he would have don had it bin received in his time. Nay he confeſſes that if the <hi>Laplanders</hi> had a mind to have their Children baptiſed, they were forc't to carry them on their backs two hundred Italian miles to a Chriſtian Church, in ſome of their neighboring Countries, as <hi>Aongermannia, Helſingia,</hi> and the like, and if they neglected this duty,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98689:19"/>there was none to reprove them for it. This made <hi>Guſtavus</hi> complain in a Letter dated at <hi>Stocholme,</hi> July 24. 1556, that there were many among them, who were never baptiſed, which proceeded from an opinion that thoſe who were baptiſed in their riper years, would dy within 7 or 8 daies after; but when <hi>Guſtavus</hi> together with his Collectors ſent Prieſts into <hi>Lapland,</hi> their children were baptiſed, and they inſtructed at home. Nor were they obliged only to a bare hearing of the word, but to a diligent atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe they were to be catechiſed afterwards, and give an account of their progreſs; ſo that now it was that they began to be Chriſtians in good earneſt, and in this reſpect it might with ſome reaſon be ſaid that in this laſt age the Goſpel began to be preached among them, and that before they were wholy ignorant of the means of their ſalvation. Now it was that they had certain Prieſts appointed to inſtruct them, the firſt whereof, or at leaſt ſince the reformation, was one <hi>Michael,</hi> whom <hi>Gustavus</hi> in his before mentioned Letter earneſtly recommends to them, giving him eſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand by pious exhortation to reduce them to the true knowledg of God, and the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
               <p>But this was more effectually don in the ſucceeding times of <hi>Charles Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtavus Adolphus,</hi> and <hi>Christina;</hi> who firſt endowed Schools and Churches; thoſe two firm ſupports, without which Religion can neither maintain its preſent ſtrength, nor acquire more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> the IX, about the latter end of his reign was the firſt that cauſed Churches to be built in every one of the diviſions or Marches at his own peculiar charge; two of them are mentioned in <hi>Lapponia Tornenſis,</hi> viz. <hi>Tenotekis</hi> and <hi>Jukasjaerff,</hi> whereof one was built, <hi>ann.</hi> 1600, the other 3 years after. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> having found a ſilver mine there, followed his example; and by a public Charter ordered the building of four more, in <hi>Arwitſieff, Arieplog, Silbojoch,</hi> and <hi>Naſafiell,</hi> ann. 1640. then were Chriſtian Churches built in <hi>Lapland</hi> it ſelf, and there are now reckoned in <hi>Lapponia Aonger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannia</hi> one, called <hi>Aoſalo;</hi> in <hi>Lapponia <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>menſis</hi> one called <hi>Lyaeſala;</hi> in <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponia Pithenſis</hi> four, whoſe name are <hi>Graatraesk, Arwitfierfs, Stora ſawgcks,</hi> and <hi>Arieplogs;</hi> there was alſo a fifth called <hi>Silbojochs,</hi> but this was long ago demoliſh'd and burnt by the <hi>Danes.</hi> In <hi>Lapponia Luhlenſis</hi> there is one call'd <hi>Jochmoch.</hi> There was alſo another called <hi>Nafrilocht,</hi> but this was burnt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally not long ſince. In <hi>Lapponia Tornenſis</hi> there are reckoned three, <hi>Juckochſierfs, Rounala,</hi> and <hi>Enotaches.</hi> In <hi>Lapponia Kimenſis</hi> only <hi>Enare.</hi> All of them being 13 in number, except <hi>Silbojochs</hi> and <hi>Nafrilochs,</hi> are kept in good repair, and frequented by the <hi>Laplanders.</hi> They all own the Kings, and eſpecially <hi>Charles</hi> the IX, for their Founders, excepting only <hi>Kounala,</hi> which was built and adorned with a bell at the ſole charge of 3 brothers <hi>Laplanders,</hi> whoſe piety herein is the more commendable becauſe they were forc't to fetch all the materials requiſit for ſuch a work thro long and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome waies, out of <hi>Norway</hi> with their Rain-dears. A memorable example which moſt men in our daies, tho deſirous enough to ſeem pious and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, are ſo far from equalling, much more from exceeding, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attemt to follow it. The manner of building their Temples was plain indeed, but fit enough for the uſe they were deſigned to, the matter of them is the ſame timber wherewith the <hi>Swedes</hi> uſually build their houſes. Adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Churches they have belfrys, and houſes for the uſe of Prieſts
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98689:19"/>and the convenience of thoſe who living at a great diſtance from the Church, have the liberty of refreſhing themſelves here in the Winter time by the fire. This conſtitution was firſt made by <hi>Christina</hi> ann. 1640, commanding the Prieſts to be alwaies reſident, whereas before they living a far off, came but at ſome ſet times of the year.</p>
               <p>Schools were firſt inſtituted by <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> and I ſuppoſe in the town of <hi>Pithen,</hi> ſomething before the year 1619, for in that year <hi>Nicolaus Andreae,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Pithen,</hi> dedicates his Ritual to him, in token of thanks and commendation for this his piety. The reaſon why <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> founded Schools, was chiefly becauſe he ſaw the <hi>Laplanders</hi> profited very little under the Swediſh Prieſts preaching in a forreign language, as they had hitherto don. Beſides, the harſhneſs of the air, and courſneſs of the diet killed great part of the Prieſts, who had bin uſed to a better climate, and made the reſt more unwilling to undergo this hardſhip: therefore was the firſt School inſtituted in <hi>Pithen,</hi> and committed to the charge of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaus Andreae,</hi> who was alſo commanded for the better promoting of knowledg there, to tranſlate the moſt uſeful and neceſſary books out of the Swediſh into the Laplandiſh tongue. For the <hi>Laplanders</hi> before this were wholy ignorant of letters, and had not a book writ in their language: the firſt, which I ſuppoſe they had, was the <hi>Primer,</hi> ſuch as children uſe to learn containing the chief heads of Chriſtian Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> the ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Apoſtles Creed, Lords Praier, and the like compiled by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Nicolaus,</hi> as himſelf witneſſes: he likewiſe was the firſt that publiſhed the Ritual in the Laplandiſh tongue, the book is now extant printed at <hi>Stockholm</hi> by <hi>Ignatius Meurer,</hi> with this title, <hi>Liber Cantionum quomodo ſit celebranda Miſſa Sermone Lappico.</hi> Theſe were the elements wherein they were firſt to be inſtructed, afterwards there were other books printed, amongſt which was a <hi>Manual</hi> tranſlated out of Swediſh by <hi>Joannes Tornaeus,</hi> Miniſter and School-maſter of <hi>Tornen,</hi> containing the Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi> Song of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Proverbs, Eccleſiaſtes, Eccleſiaſticus, <hi>Luthers</hi> Catechiſe, ſacred Hymns, Goſpels, and Epiſtles, with the ſolemn Praiers. The hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Paſſion, and deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the <hi>Ritual,</hi> and Praiers of all ſorts.</p>
               <p>In the next place, for an encouragement to thoſe that would ſend their children to School, <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> allowed money, not only for their diet, but alſo for their clothes, and other neceſſaries, with a ſtipend for the School-maſter: with theſe helps the <hi>Laplanders</hi> began more ſeriouſly to conſider of the Chriſtian Religion, which was now preach'd to them in no other language then their own: heretofore their Miniſters uſing only the Swediſh tongue, they learnt ſomthing but underſtood it not, and mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſome Praiers, but they knew not what: for ſomtimes there ſtood under the Pulpit, an Interpreter who explained to the People as well as he could what the Miniſter ſaid at length. By the benefit of theſe aforeſaid books they began to underſtand what they praied for, and ſome of the Youth of <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> having ſtudied at the Univerſity of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal,</hi> made ſo good progreſs in the knowledg of the Liberal Arts and Sciences, and of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that they were entruſted with the Miniſtery.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we have taken a view of <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> his firſt care for the advancement of Chriſtianity in <hi>Lapland,</hi> but as all things in their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98689:20"/>find ſome oppoſition, ſo did the preaching of the word of God here; firſt of all it was a matter of great difficulty to maintain a School without the confines of <hi>Lapland,</hi> to which the Youth of that Nation ſhould reſort, therefore in the ſecond place it was adviſed by that famous man <hi>Joannes Skytte,</hi> free Baron of <hi>Duderhoff,</hi> and Senator of the Kingdom, who to his immortal praiſe obtained that a School might be erected by the King in <hi>Lapland</hi> it ſelf, in the Province of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ma,</hi> near the Church <hi>Lykſala,</hi> from whence the School took its name. This was the ſecond School the <hi>Laplanders</hi> had, and by <hi>Gustavus Adolphus,</hi> then engaged in a tedious war in <hi>Germany,</hi> the charge of it was committed to the aforeſaid <hi>Joannes Skytte,</hi> by a Roial Charter, and ſetled upon his Family for ever, allowing the School-maſter the whole Tithe, after the ordinary charges deducted; but ſtill retaining to the Crown the ſuperintendency of the benefaction.

               <p>This School had ſome peculiar advantages over others, becauſe its ſetle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was firmly eſtabliſhed, having for its Viſitor, not the Miniſter of the Pariſh, but a Senator of the Kingdom.

But all inconveniences were here remedied and the ſalary moſt firmly ſetled; and not only ſo, but alſo full autority granted unto the Illuſtrious Lord <hi>John Skytte</hi> to find out and confirm any other means, which might conduce more to the good of that foundation. Neither was that eminent man wanting out of his ſingular piety to God, and love of learning, to make this his whole buſineſs, till at laſt he gathered a ſum of five thouſand Dollars, partly thro his own, and partly thro his friends liberality, which he delivered to the Queen <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stina</hi> for the uſe of a Copper Mine, that in lieu thereof the School of <hi>

               <p>From this teſtimony it appears that the School was frequented by no
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98689:22"/>ſmall number of the Laplandiſh Youth, alſo that they were not wholly unfit for the ſtudy of learning and Religion; making it their chief care to learn thoſe things which are eſpecially neceſſary to the improving of a Chriſtian life. Laſt of all, the readineſs of the <hi>Laplanders</hi> to ſend their children to School: ſo that now there appears another face of Religion in <hi>Lapland</hi> then what there was in former ages, becauſe the Kings have taken greater care in providing for Churches, Schools, Books, Miniſters, and School-maſters. The Prieſts in like manner are more careful, being now for the moſt part <hi>Laplanders,</hi> or skilful in that tongue, whereof there is in <hi>Lapponia <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>menſis</hi> one, in <hi>Lapponia Pithenſis</hi> 3, in <hi>Lapponia Luhlenſis</hi> one, whoſe trouble is the greater, becauſe the Country is large and the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants diſperſed.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Lapponia Tornenſis</hi> and <hi>Kiemenſis</hi> they have both Laplandiſh and Swed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Prieſts, who once a year at their public Fairs in February viſit the Country, baptiſing their children, and preaching to them in the <hi>Finniſh</hi> language, which they ſeem to underſtand. For their reward they have one third part of the Rain-dears, which the <hi>Laplanders</hi> are bound to pay to the Crown: and whereas every <hi>Laplander</hi> was obliged to pay for a tax ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two pair of ſhoes, or a white Fox, or a pound of Pike, this is now equally divided between the King and the Prieſt; which makes not only the Prieſts more chearful in doing their duty, but the People alſo more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in their performances. Hence it is that they pay their Miniſters ſo much honor and reſpect, ſaluting them at their firſt coming with bowing their head, giving them in token of Reverence the title of <hi>Herrai,</hi> i.e. <hi>Sir,</hi> conducting them upon their Rain-dears to their Cottages, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with birch bows, covered with their furrs, and ſhewing them all the civility they have. Upon a table or rather a plank laid upon the ground they ſet them meat, which is uſually fiſh, or fleſh of Rain-dear dried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the tongue and marrow. They uſe neither Salt, Bread nor Wine, all which the Prieſs are forc't to bring with them, the <hi>Laplanders</hi> drinking only Water, becauſe the extremity of the cold ſpoils their Beer. They are careful in obſerving Sundaies, refraining both themſelves and their Cattel from all work on that day, and ſomtimes on the day before; nay ſome there are who refuſe to milk their Raindears on Sundaies. While the Sermon is preaching they attend diligently; and in ſinging of Pſalms they are ſo zealous that they ſtrive who ſhall ſing beſt. They very much reverence and frequent the Sacraments, eſpecially that of Baptiſm which they never defer; but the women themſelves within eight or fourteen daies after their delivery do often bring their children thro long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious waies to the Prieſt. They likewiſe pay much reverence to the Lords Supper, and to the ceremonies of Confeſſion and Abſolution, which are alwaies uſed before that Sacrament, which they now are really partakers of, whereas in the times of Popery they received it without any ſolemn conſecration. Neither do they neglect the other parts of Chriſtian Piety. They moſt religiouſly abſtain from ſwearing, curſing and blaſphemy: they are very charitable to the poor, and juſt, inſomuch that there are ſcarce any rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries ever heard of in the Country. Their mutual converſation is very cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, eſpecially among perſons of the ſame Country or family, often viſiting and diſcourſing with one another. This they learn from the precepts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98689:22"/>which requiring them not only to regulate their Faith, but their lives, teaches that tho there be three Perſons, the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, yet they are but one God. And as by the help of Chriſtianity they learn the rule of true piety; ſo do they utterly abhor all their ancient ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition. They pull down all their drums, and burn and demoliſh all their Images of wood and ſtone. A memorable example hereof is mentioned by <hi>Johannes Tornaeus</hi> in this manner. A certain <hi>Laplander,</hi> juſt, pious, and wealthy, named <hi>Petrus Peiwie</hi> dwelling in <hi>Peldojaerf,</hi> at a Village of <hi>Lapp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markia Tornenſis,</hi> with all his family worſhipped the Idol <hi>Seita:</hi> it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened upon a certain time that his Rain-dears died in great numbers; whereupon he implored the aſſiſtance of his <hi>Seita.</hi> But he praied in vain, for his Rain-dears died ſtill. At length with his whole family and good ſtore of dry wood, he took a journy to the place where <hi>Seita</hi> ſtood: round about the Idoll he ſtrewed green bows of Firr, and offered ſacrifice to him, the skins, horns, and skulls of Rain-dears; at laſt he proſtrates himſelf with his whole family before the Idol, beſeeching him that he would by ſome ſign teſtify unto him, that he was the true God. But after a whole days praiers and devotions finding no ſign given, he ſets fire to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible wood, and burns down the Idol of the Town. When his offended neighbours ſought to kill him, he asked them why they would not permit the God to revenge himſelf for the affront. But <hi>Peiwie</hi> became ſo conſtant an adherent to the Chriſtian Religion, that when others threatned with their charms to miſchief him, he on the contrary repeated the Lords Prayer, and the Apoſtles Creed. He burnt all the <hi>Seitas</hi> he could meet with, and at length ſent his eldeſt Son <hi>Wuollaba</hi> to <hi>Enorreby</hi> to do the like there; for which he was forc't to fly into <hi>Norway</hi> to avoid the <hi>Inarenſes,</hi> who lay in wait for him. There was alſo one <hi>Clement,</hi> a <hi>Lappo-Jenabienſis</hi> whoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being grievouſly ſick, he ſought remedy from the Drum, but his Mother died notwithſtanding; whereupon he cut his Drum in pieces, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that he ſaw no uſe of it.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we have ſeen the Chriſtian Religion much better received and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> and applied to their daily converſation, then what it was in ancient times. And from hence we may collect the care of thoſe who by their authority, counſell or miniſtery did promote it; yet cannot we triumph over Pagan impiety wholly rooted out; as ſhall appear by the following Chapter.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of ſome remains of Paganiſm in <hi>Lapland</hi> at this time.</head>
               <p>BY the preſent State of Religion in <hi>Lapland,</hi> it cannot be doubted but all poſſible means were uſed by their pious Kings and Prieſts, for the extirpating of ſuperſtition and its evil conſequences: nevertheleſs there remain ſome reliques thereof to employ their farther care and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, many groſs errours prevailing among them, which renders the reality of their converſion ſuſpicious, as if they were ſtill in love with the erroneous opinions of their Anceſtors, eſpecially ſome of the <hi>Norwegian Laplanders,</hi> whoſe Idolatry ſufficiently demonſtrates that all their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to Chriſtianity are but fictitious. But tho it were impiety to believe this of all, ſince experience ſhews us the contrary; yet it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but that many of them profeſs Chriſtianity rather out of diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then any real affection. One chief reaſon why they ſo ſtifly adhere to their ſuperſtition and impiety, proceeds from the miſcarriage of their Prieſts, who either take no care of inſtructing the People, or vilify their doctrine by the ſordidneſs of their lives; whilſt under a pretence of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating the Goſpell, they endeavor only to advance their own revennues. This the <hi>Laplandens,</hi> before none of the richeſt, could not bare; to ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves oppreſt and diſabled by the exactions of the Prieſts. The truth of this <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> ſtrives to confute, calling it an impious and falſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, but he brings nothing to prove the truth of what he ſaies, nor anſwers <hi>Ziegler,</hi> by telling a fair ſtory, of the induſtry and liberality of ſome in the Southern parts: and particularly that his brother <hi>Joannes</hi> came to the utmoſt border of <hi>Jemptia,</hi> and gave a large Alms to the poor people there, and at his own great charge ſet up a Salt-work. A farther cauſe of the little improvement of Chriſtianity, is the vaſtneſs of the Country, ſome of the Inhabitants living above 200 miles from the Chriſtian Churches. But tho this cauſe is now in ſome degree removed by having Churches more frequently, yet that inconvenience ſtill remains; becauſe they are yet very far diſtant, particularly in <hi>Lapponia Luhlenſis,</hi> as we have already mentioned. There are other cauſes of this unhappy effect, which more particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the Natives. As their ſtrong inclination to ſuperſtition, which hath bin formerly mentioned, and the occaſions thereof intimated. To this we may add the high eſtimation they have of their Predeceſſors, whom they think more wiſe then to have bin ignorant of what God they ought to adore, or the manner of his worſhip: wherefore out of reverence to them they will not recede from their opinions, leaſt they ſhould ſeem to reprove them of ignorance or impiety. Laſtly, this happens upon the account of inveterate Cuſtom, which at all times is hardly forgot, eſpecially where it prevails as a Law. This is it that darkens their underſtanding, and renders it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98689:23"/>of diſcerning between true and falſe. For theſe and ſome other reaſons there remain ſeverall tracks of Superſtition and Idolatry, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> require no ſmall time to be wore out; as we ſee in ſeverall of the meaner ſort, not only in <hi>Swedland,</hi> but in <hi>Germany, France,</hi> and other Countries, where there is found much of the old ſuperſtition, tho in other things they are orthodox enough.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the <hi>Laplanders</hi> theſe opinions may be reduced to two heads, for they are ſuperſtitious and paganiſh, or Magical and Diabolical. Of the firſt ſort ſome of their ſuperſtitions are only vain and fabulous, others very impious and heatheniſh. As firſt of all their diſtinctions between white and black daies. Of the later ſort they account the Feaſts of <hi>S. Katharine</hi> and <hi>S. Mark,</hi> whom they call <hi>Cantepaive,</hi> and <hi>S. Clement,</hi> upon which daies they abſtain from all buſineſs, and chiefly from hunting. And of this they give two reaſons; firſt, becauſe they ſay if they ſhould hunt on any of thoſe daies, their bows and arrows would be broken, and they ſhould forfeit their good ſucceſs in that ſport all the year. In like manner they eſteem the firſt day of Chriſtmas to be unlucky, inſomuch that Maſters of families go not out of their Cottages, not ſo much as to Church, but ſend their Children and Servants, for fear of I know not what ſpirits and daemons, which they ſuppoſe to wander about the air in great Companies upon that day; and that they muſt firſt be appeaſed by certain Sacrifices, which we ſhall mention hereafter. This ſuperſtition, I ſuppoſe, ſprang from a miſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the ſtory which they heard from their Prieſt, how a great hoſt of Angels came down from Heaven upon our Saviours Nativity, and frighted the Shepheards. They are likewiſe great obſervers of Omens, and amongſt others they gueſs at the ſucceſs of the day from the firſt beaſt they meet in the morning. They forbid the woman to go out of that door thro which the man went a hunting, as thinking the way would be improſperous if a woman trod the ſame ſteps.</p>
               <p>And herein they are only ſuperſtitious but in what follows, they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and heatheniſh. As firſt they go to Church not out of any devotion, but compulſion. Next they ſtick at ſeveral Principles of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, eſpecially the reſurrection of the dead, the union of the body and ſoul, and the immortality of the ſoul. For they fancy to themſelves that men and beaſts go the ſame way; and will not be perſwaded that there is any life after this. Whereupon one <hi>Georgius,</hi> a Laplandiſh Prieſt, deſired upon his death bed that he might be buried amongſt the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> that at the laſt day when he ſhould riſe together with them, they might find his doctrine of the reſurrection true. Notwithſtanding they believe that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a man remains after he is dead, but they know not what it is; which was the very opinion of the Heathens, who therefore feign'd their Manes to be ſomewhat that did remain after their death. A third impiety they are guilty of, is joining their own feign'd gods with God and Chriſt, and paying them equall reverence and worſhip, as if God and the Devil had made an agreement together to ſhare their devotions between them.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of <hi>Lapponia Pithenſis</hi> and <hi>Luhlenſis</hi> have their greater and leſſer Gods; the greater to whom they pay eſpecial worſhip are, <hi>Thor, Storjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>karen,</hi> and the <hi>Sun. Damianus à Goes</hi> writes that they worſhip the Fire and Statues of ſtone: but thoſe Statues are only the Images of <hi>Storjunkaren,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:98689:24"/>and the Fire is only an embleme of the Sun; for that they worſhipped Fire it ſelf for a God, is very falſe, as appears from <hi>Tornaeus,</hi> who made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular enquiry into that thing. The ſame may be ſaid of <hi>Peucer,</hi> who taking his miſtake from the wooden Image of <hi>Thor,</hi> reports that they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip wood. So that there are only three, and that among the <hi>Pithenſes</hi> and <hi>Luhlenſes;</hi> for the <hi>Tornenſes</hi> and <hi>Kiemenſes</hi> knew nothing of them, but in their ſtead under one common name worſhipped a Deity, whom they called <hi>Seita,</hi> whereof every family and almoſt every perſon had one. Nevertheleſs there was one chief Idoll to which all the neighbourhood paid devotion. But tho this word <hi>Seita</hi> denotes any God among the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> yet may we ſuppoſe that under that name, eſpecially as it ſignifies the publick Idoll, they worſhipped the ſame, which the <hi>Luhlenſes</hi> call <hi>Tiermes,</hi> or <hi>Aijeke</hi> (i. e.) thunderer, or father, by others named <hi>Thor.</hi> And by the private Idols they mean't him, who by the <hi>Luhlenſes</hi> is called <hi>Storjunkare,</hi> making the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to conſiſt not in the Gods but their names. The <hi>Tornenſes</hi> rather uſing a generall appellation, and calling them all <hi>Seitas,</hi> whereas the <hi>Luhlenſes</hi> call the greater <hi>Termes</hi> or <hi>Aijeke,</hi> and the leſſer <hi>Storjunkar.</hi> And if one at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to their manner of worſhipping theſe Gods, they will appear to be the ſame. Beſides theſe greater, the <hi>Pithenſes, Luhlenſes,</hi> and their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours have ſome inferior Gods, as the <hi>Tornenſes</hi> likewiſe have, tho they worſhip them all under one name, excepting only that which they call <hi>Wiru Accha,</hi> ſignifying a <hi>Livonian</hi> old woman, which <hi>Olaus Petr.</hi> with ſome alteration calls <hi>Vireſaka.</hi> This was only the bare trunk of a tree, and is now wholly rotten. But who the inferior Gods were, or to what end they were worſhipped, there is no mention made; but we may gueſs from what we find obſervable among the other <hi>Laplanders.</hi> Firſt under that name they worſhipped the ghoſts of departed perſons, but eſpecially of their kindred, for they thought there was ſome divinity in them, and that they were able to do harm: juſt ſuch as the <hi>Romans</hi> fancied their Manes to be; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was that they offered Sacrifice to them, of which more hereafter. Beſides theſe Manes they worſhip other Spectres and Demons, which they ſay wander about Rocks, Woods, Rivers and Lakes, ſuch as the <hi>Romans</hi> deſcribe their <hi>Fauni, Sylvani,</hi> and <hi>Tritons</hi> to be. The third ſort dreaded by them are <hi>Genii,</hi> whether good or bad, which they ſuppoſe to fly in the air about Chriſtmas, as we intimated before; theſe they call <hi>Juhlii</hi> from the word <hi>Juhl,</hi> denoting at preſent the Nativity of Chriſt; but formerly the new year. And theſe are the Gods which the <hi>Laplanders</hi> jointly adore with God and our Saviour; of which we ſhall now ſpeak particularly, and of their reſpective worſhip.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the heatheniſh Gods of the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> and their manner of worſhip at this day.</head>
               <p>WE have ſhewed in the foregoing Chapter that there were three principal Gods worſhipped by the <hi>Laplanders;</hi> the firſt is <hi>Thor,</hi> ſignifying thunder, in the Swediſh Dialect called <hi>Thordoen,</hi> by the <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> themſelves <hi>Tiermes,</hi> that is any thing that makes a noiſe, agreeing very well with the notion the <hi>Romans</hi> had of <hi>Jupiter</hi> the thunderer, and the God <hi>Taramis,</hi> which I have treated of in the Hiſtory of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal.</hi> This <hi>Tiermes</hi> or thunder they think by a ſpecial virtue in the Sky to be alive; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating thereby that power from whence thunder proceeds, or the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring God, wherefore he is by them called <hi>Aljeke,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>grand,</hi> or <hi>great-grand-Father,</hi> as the <hi>Romans</hi> ſaluted their father <hi>Jupiter;</hi> and the <hi>Swedes</hi> their <hi>Gubba.</hi> This <hi>Aijeke</hi> when he thunders is by the <hi>Laplanders</hi> call'd <hi>Tiermes,</hi> by the <hi>Scythians, Tarami,</hi> and by the <hi>Swedes, Tor</hi> or <hi>Toron.</hi> This <hi>Tiermes</hi> or <hi>Aijeke</hi> the <hi>Laplanders</hi> ſuppoſe to have power over the life and death, health and ſickneſs of man: and alſo over the hurtfull Demons who frequent Rocks and Mountains, whom he often chaſtiſes, and ſometimes deſtroies with his lightning, as the <hi>Latins</hi> fanci'd their <hi>Jupiter</hi> to do, for which end they give him a bow in his hand to ſhoot the Demons with, which they call <hi>Aijeke dauge:</hi> alſo they give him a mallet, which they call <hi>Aijeke Wetſchera,</hi> to daſh out the brains of the ſaid evil ſpirits. Wherefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Laplanders</hi> expect ſo many bleſſings from their <hi>Tiermes,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he beſtows life on them, and preſerves their health, and that they cannot die unleſs it be his pleſure, and drives away the Demons, which are prejudicial to their hunting, fowling, and fiſhing, and never hurts them but when their offences deſerve it: therefore he is to be worſhipped in the firſt place. The next of the principal Gods is <hi>Storjunkare,</hi> which the it be a <hi>Norwegian</hi> word, <hi>Junkare</hi> in that language ſignifying the Governor of a Province, yet is it uſed by the <hi>Laplanders</hi> now; tho perhaps it was not in uſe till ſome of them became ſubjects to <hi>Norway.</hi> Certain it is, that this is not the only name of that God, for he is alſo called <hi>Stourra Paſſe</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Great Saint,</hi> as appears by a Hymn which is ſung at his Sacrifices. His name they reverence very much, and pay him frequenter, if not greater devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then other Gods, for they ſuppoſe him to be their <hi>Tiermes</hi> his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, and as it were Royal Prefect, adding <hi>Stoere,</hi> which ſignifys <hi>greater</hi> for diſtinction ſake. Now they worſhip <hi>Storejunkar,</hi> becauſe they think that they receive all their bleſſings thro his hands, and that all beaſts and Cattel, are ſubject to his will, and that he governs them as <hi>Tiermes</hi> doth men and ſpirits; wherefore he can give them to whom he will, and none can receive them without his pleaſure. Theſe beaſts therefore ſupplying the <hi>Laplanders</hi> with meat and clothes, it may eaſily be imagined how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98689:25"/>they held it to worſhip <hi>Storjunkare.</hi> And theſe are the two pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Gods of the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> whereof one hath the dominion over men, the other over beaſts; one beſtows life, the other all things required to the ſuſtaining of it. <hi>Tornaeus</hi> ſaies they report of him that he hath often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to Fowlers or Fiſhers in the ſhape of a tall perſonable man, habited like a Nobleman, with a Gun in his hand, and his feet like thoſe of a bird. As often as he appears ſtanding on the ſhore, or in the ſhip by them, they ſay he makes their fiſhing ſucceſsful, and kills birds that happen to fly by with his Gun, which he beſtows upon thoſe that are preſent. It is reported that a <hi>Laplander</hi> being to guide one of the Kings Lieutenant, when he came over againſt a mountain where <hi>Storejunkar</hi> was ſuppoſed to dwell, he ſtood ſtill, and ſetting the helve of his Ax down upon the Ice, turned it round, profeſſing that he did it in honor of their munificent God, who dwelt there. And tho there is mention made but of one mountain where the <hi>Laplander</hi> performed this ceremony, yet we may ſuppoſe he would have don it oftner, if there had happened to be more hills in the way. But perhaps this diſtinction of name is uſed by the <hi>Laplanders</hi> which border upon <hi>Norway,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Lulalapland,</hi> from his habit and clothing; and becauſe he uſed to appear in another dreſs to them of <hi>Lapponia Kiemenſis</hi> and <hi>Tornenſis,</hi> therefore they did not worſhip him under that name, but by the common appellation of <hi>Seita,</hi> from whom they believed that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the benefits of hunting, fiſhing, and fowling.</p>
               <p>I come now to the <hi>Sun,</hi> their third God, which is common to them with all other Pagans, him they call <hi>Baiwe,</hi> and worſhip him chiefly for his light and heat: alſo becauſe they believe him to be the Author of Generation, and that all things are made by his means, eſpecially their Rain-dears, of whom and their young they think he hath a particular care to cheriſh them by his heat, and bring them ſuddenly to ſtrength and maturity. And being they live in a cold Country where their native heat is diminiſh'd, and often wholly extinguiſh'd, being they have nothing to ſuſtain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with but the fleſh of Rain-dear, they think it very fit to pay the Sun very great honors, who is the Author of ſo great bleſſings to them, and who at his return reſtores them that light which they loſt by his departure, and that not for a day or two, but for ſeveral weeks, which being pai'd, the new day ſeems more welcom to them, by reaſon of long abſence.</p>
               <p>To every one of theſe principal Gods they pay a ſeveral ſort of worſhip; which conſiſts firſt in the diverſity of places dedicated to their ſervice, next in the diverſity of images erected to them in theſe places; laſtly, in the diverſity of Sacrifices which they offer to them. The place where they worſhip their <hi>Thor</hi> or <hi>Tiermes</hi> is a piece of ground ſet apart for this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, on the backſide of their Huts, above a bows ſhoot off; there upon boards ſet together like a table they place their images. This table ſerves them inſtead of an Altar, which they ſurround with bows of birch and pine; with the ſame bows alſo they ſtrew the way from their Huts to the Altar: and as the table ſerves them for an Altar, ſo do the bows for a Temple. The ſame account, only omitting the table, doth <hi>Tornaeus</hi> give of the <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſes</hi> and <hi>Kiemenſes</hi> worſhipping of <hi>Seita,</hi> ſo that they may ſeem to be one and the ſame God: unleſs his deſcription ſhould be appli'd to <hi>Storjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kar</hi> rather, becauſe he mentions Lakes to be the place of his worſhip; which
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98689:25"/>was proper to <hi>Storjunkar,</hi> as ſhall be ſhewn. But I ſuppoſe the <hi>Seitas</hi> were worſhipped in other places as well as Lakes, and ſo they ſignifi'd both Gods under one name, and that <hi>Tornaeus</hi> was not ſo curious as to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between them. In the ſame place where they worſhipp'd <hi>Tiermes</hi> they worſhipp'd the Sun alſo, and upon the ſame table too, which makes me ſuſpect that they were but one God; whom they called <hi>Tiermes,</hi> when they invok'd him in the behalf of their lives, healths, or preſervation from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and <hi>Baiwe</hi> when they beg'd of him light or warmth, or any thing that might fortify them againſt the cold. But the place where <hi>Storjunkar</hi> was worſhipped, was upon ſome peculiar mountains, and on the banks of Lakes: for almoſt every family hath its particular rocks and hills appointed for this buſineſs. Some of theſe rocks are ſo high and craggy that they are impaſſable to any but <hi>Storjunkar.</hi> But it muſt not be ſuppoſed he lives only in rocks and cliffes of mountains, but alſo on the ſhores of Lakes and banks of Rivers, for there alſo he is peculiarly worſhipped, becauſe the <hi>Laplanders</hi> have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the ſame apparitions in theſe places, that they uſually do upon rocks and hills, namely <hi>Storjunkar</hi> habited and armed according to the deſcription already given, by which his preſence they think he teſtifies his great love for thoſe places, which therefore they have in great vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and call them <hi>Paſſewara,</hi> i. e. <hi>Sacred mountains,</hi> or rocks belonging to <hi>Storjunkar,</hi> ſuppoſing they cannot pay their devotion to him in any place better, or be ſurer of finding him, then where he himſelf appears. To theſe places they allot their certain bounds and confines, that all people may know how far the ſanctified ground reaches, and avoid thoſe evils, which otherwiſe <hi>Storejunkar</hi> would certainly inflict upon them for violating his holy place. Now ſince every family, that is given to this ſuperſtition hath its peculiar place of worſhip, it is manifeſt that there is good ſtore of them throughout <hi>Lapland. Sam. Rheen</hi> reckons up thirty of them in the Province of <hi>Luhla.</hi>

               <p>Neither are theſe are the places in the Country that are dedicated to this uſe, but there are ſeveral others which the Idolatrous People endeavour to concele, that they may avoid the ſuſpicion of this impiety and their deſerved puniſhment. But in other parts of <hi>Lapland</hi> the number is far greater as may be eaſily underſtood; and therefore I ſhall not tire the Reader with a recitall of them. For all theſe places they have a high eſteem, whether dedicated to <hi>Thor,</hi> the <hi>Sun,</hi> or <hi>Storjunkar,</hi> ſo that they exclude all women from them; not permitting them ſo much as to go behind the houſe where <hi>Thor</hi> is worſhipped, and prohibiting all marriageble women to come near the borders of <hi>Storjunkars</hi> conſecrated hills: and the reaſon is becauſe they think that Sex, eſpecially at that age, not pure enough for thoſe devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but not knowing who are pure and who are not, to prevent all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they prohibite the whole Sex, who if they tranſgreſs herein, they muſt expect many misfortunes to befall them, and perhaps death it ſelf.</p>
               <p>I come now to the Images of their Gods, for with theſe they uſed to honour them. <hi>Thors</hi> image, was alwaies made of wood, wherefore he is called by them <hi>Muora Jubmel,</hi> i. e. the wooden God. And becauſe in <hi>Lapponia Tornenſis,</hi> as well as in other places they make their Gods of wood, it is very probable that they worſhip <hi>Tiermes,</hi> tho they call him <hi>Seita.</hi> Of this wood, which is alwaies Birch, they make ſo many Idols as they have Sacrifices, and when they have done they keep them in a cave by ſome hill ſide. The ſhape of them is very rude, only at the top they are made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent a mans head, according to the deſcription of <hi>Matthias Steuchius,</hi> which he relates from his Father, who was Superintendent of <hi>Hernoſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſis,</hi> and had the overſight of all things relating to Piety and Religion in moſt parts of <hi>Lapland.</hi> Of the root of the tree they make the head, and of the trunk the body of the image: for thoſe Birches which grow in Fenny grounds have uſually their roots growing round, and from them there ſhoot out other little roots, ſo that it is eaſily fitted to the ſhape of a mans head. Now to manifeſt this to be <hi>Thor,</hi> they put a hammer into his right hand, which is as it were his enſign by which he is known. Into his head they drive a nail of Iron or Steel, and a ſmall piece of flint to ſtrike fire with, if he hath a mind to it. Tho I rather ſuppoſe it was firſt uſed to be an emblem of fire, which together with the Sun they worſhipped in <hi>Thor,</hi> whoſe Image is here delineated.</p>

               <p>I come now to their Sacrifices and other Ceremonies uſed to their Gods. Firſt it is obſervable that they are performed only by men, all women being excluded; they eſteeming it as great a crime for a woman to offer Sacrifice as to frequent the conſecrated places. They never offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice till they have enquired of their God whether he will accept it or no. This they do with a certain inſtrument which they call <hi>Kannus,</hi> not unlike the old faſhioned Drums, from whence they are uſually called Laplandiſh Drums, and ſhall be exactly deſcribed hereafter. This Drum being beaten, and ſome Songs ſung, they bring the deſigned Sacrifice to <hi>Thor,</hi> who if he ſignifies by a ring in the Drum that the Sacrifice is pleaſing to him, they fall preſently to work: otherwiſe they carry it to the Sun, and ſo to <hi>Stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junkar,</hi> till one of them will accept of it. The manner of it is thus. They pull off ſome of the hair at the bottom of the beaſts neck, and bind it to a ring which is faſtned to the Drum, then one of them beats the Drum, and all the reſt ſing theſe words, <hi>What ſayſt thou ô Great and Sacred God, doſt thou accept this Sacrifice, which we deſign to offer unto thee?</hi> And while they chant theſe words, they repete the name of the mountain where they are: then if the ring reſts on that part of the Drum where the God is pictured, they take it for granted that the God is pleaſed, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Ceremony; or elſe they carry the Sacrifice to <hi>Thor,</hi> and uſe the like form of words, <hi>Father God will you have my Sacrifice. Peucer</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98689:27"/>thro falſe intelligence, or miſapprehenſion, relates this buſineſs ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing differently, they have (ſaies he) a braſen Drum whereon they paint ſeveral ſorts of Beaſts, Birds, and Fiſhes, ſuch as they can eaſily procure: bolt upright upon this Drum they fix an iron pearch, upon which ſtands a braſen Frog, which at the beating of the Drum falls down upon ſome of the pictures, and that creature whoſe picture the Frog touches, they ſacrifice. Their uſuall ſacrifices are Rain-dears, tho ſometimes they uſe other creatures, as Dogs, Cats, Lambs and Hens, which they fetch out of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi> The 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> thing obſervable is that they offer their Sacrifices uſually in the Autumn, becauſe, I ſuppoſe, the Winter and night being at hand they think they have more need of their Gods aſſiſtance, which may probably be the reaſon too why every year about that time they make a new image for <hi>Thor,</hi> which is alwaies don 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> daies before Michaelmas. And thus they conſecrate it, firſt they ſacrifice the Rain-dear, then taking out his bones they anoint the Idol with the blood and fat, and bury the fleſh and bones under ground. Beſides this Idol they erect one to him every time they ſacrifice, and then they place them all one by another upon a table behind their Hut. Firſt when the God hath approved of the Sacrifice, which is uſually a Buck to <hi>Thor,</hi> they bind it behind the houſe, then with a ſharp knife they run him thro the heart, and gather the heart-blood, wherewith they anoint the Idol, into a veſſell. After that having placed the images right, and adorned the table, they approach reverently to it, anoint the head and back all over with the blood, but on his breaſt they only draw ſeveral Croſſes. Behind him they place the skull, feet, and horns of the ſacrificed Dear; before him they place a Coffer made of the bark of Birch, into which they put a bit of every member of the Rain-dear, with ſome of the fat, and the reſt of the fleſh they convert to their private uſes. This is the manner of the <hi>Laplanders</hi> ſacrificing to <hi>Thor.</hi> But when they offer Sacrifice to <hi>Storjunkar,</hi> which is likewiſe a male Dear, then firſt they run a red thred thro his right ear, and bind him, and ſacrifice him in the place they did that to <hi>Thor;</hi> preſerving the blood likewiſe in a veſſel. Then he who performs the Ceremony takes the horns and the bones of the head and neck, with the feet and hoofs, and carries them to the mountain of that <hi>Storjunkar,</hi> for whom the Sacrifice was deſigned. When he comes near the ſacred Stone, he reverently uncovers his head, and bows his body, paying all the ceremonies of reſpect and honor. Then he anoints the Stone with the fat and blood, and places the horns behind it. Unto the right horn they ty the Rain-dears yard, and to the left ſome red thred wrought upon tin with a little piece of ſilver. The ſame rites that are obſerved to <hi>Storjunkar</hi> are alſo uſed to <hi>Seita,</hi> to whom the <hi>Laplanders</hi> uſually ſacrifice upon Holydaies, or after ſome loſs or misfortune. Then making their Praiers and Devotions to the Idol in their beſt clothes, they offer him all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of oblations, and the choiſeſt parts of the Rain-dear, as the fleſh, fat, skin, bones, horns, and hoofs, whereof there are great heaps to be ſeen at this day where <hi>Seita</hi> was worſhipped. The horns are found placed one above another, in the faſhion of a fence to the God, which is therefore by the <hi>Laplanders</hi> called <hi>Tiorfwigardi,</hi> that is a Court fenced with horns, which are ſometimes above a thouſand in number. Before theſe horns they uſed to hang a garland made of Birch tree, ſtuck about with bits of fleſh cut
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98689:28"/>from every member of the ſacrifice. This I ſuppoſe firſt cauſed the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of thoſe who reported that the <hi>Laplanders</hi> worſhipped the horns of Rain-dears. All the fleſh that remains of the ſacrifice the <hi>Laplanders</hi> ſpend in their houſes: and this is the ordinary way of ſacrificing to <hi>Stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junkar.</hi> Two other methods there are but leſs uſed; one when they bring the ſacrifice alive to the hill where the Idol is placed: another when they would do ſo, but cannot climb the hill where <hi>Storjunkar</hi> is by reaſon of its ſteepneſs. For the firſt they kill the ſacrifice hard by the Idol, and when they have performed the uſual ceremonies, they preſently boil the fleſh in the place, eſpecially that about the head and neck, and invite their friends to the eating of it. This they call <hi>Storjunkars</hi> Feaſt, and when they have done they leave the skin behind them. This is not uſed in all <hi>Stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junkars</hi> hills, but only in ſome peculiar place where he hath manifeſted to them that he will be worſhipped ſo. The other way of ſacrificing is when the hill is ſo craggy that they cannot aſcend it with their ſacrifice, then they throw up a ſtone to the top of the mountain, which they dip in the blood and go away, as having paid their devotion. But as (beſides the ſacrifice) they once a year honour <hi>Thor</hi> with a new Image; ſo do they <hi>Storjunkar</hi> with freſh bowes twice every year. The firſt time in Summer with birch and graſs; next in Winter with pine. The ſame alſo <hi>Tornaeus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of the <hi>Seitas.</hi> Then it is they ſeek whether their God be favorable and propitious to them or no: for when they go to ſtrow the bows and graſs under him, if the ſtone proves light, they hope he will be kind; but if it be ſomething heavier then ordinary, they ſuſpect he is angry with them, and immediatly to reconcile him they devote ſome oblations to him. And thus are <hi>Peucerus</hi> his words to be underſtood, when the <hi>Laplanders</hi> (ſays he) go a hunting or fiſhing, or upon any other enterpriſe, they try their ſucceſs by the weight of their God, who if he is eaſily moved, they take it for granted that he approves of their deſign; if hardly, then he diſlikes it: but if he be unmoveable then they ſuppoſe him offended with them. This is not to be underſtood of all their affairs, but only when they lay freſh ſtraw under him, for at other times they enquire his pleſure with a drum, of which I have already ſpoken.</p>
               <p>It remains now that we treat of the ſacrifices uſed to the Sun, theſe are young Rain-dears, and thoſe not bucks but does: the rites are moſt of them the ſame with thoſe already mentioned; only inſtead of a red ſtring thro the right ear of <hi>Storjunkars</hi> ſacrifice, they run a white one thro the Suns; then they make a garland, not of birch, but willow, about as big as the hoop of an Hogshead. This they place upon a table behind the Hut where they ſacrifice to <hi>Thor,</hi> not upon the ſame table, but one like it. And this ſacrifice differs from the other in that there are neither images erected here, nor horns, the beaſts being not come to their growth. But that there may be ſome reſemblance of the Sun, they place the chief bones of the ſacrifice upon the table in a circle.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe 3 principal Gods they have ſome petty ones, as the Manes of deceaſed men, and the <hi>Julii</hi> troops. They have no particular names for the Ghoſts, but call them all <hi>Sitte:</hi> neither do they erect them images as they do to <hi>Thor</hi> and <hi>Storjunkar;</hi> only they offer them ſome certain ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. At which time their firſt buſineſs is to enquire the will of the dead,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98689:28"/>whether it pleaſe him to be worſhipt with that kind of ſacrifice in theſe words, <hi>Maijke werro Jabmike ſitte, ô you Manes what will you have,</hi> then they beat the drum, and if the ring falls upon any creature there pictured they take it for the ſacrifice which the ghoſt deſires: they then run thro his ear, or, as others ſay, ty about his horns a woollen black thred. Having performed the ſacrifice, they ſpend all the fleſh upon their own uſes; except a bit of the heart, and another of the lungs: each of which they divide into 3 parts, and faſten them upon as many ſticks, which they dip in the blood of the ſacrifice, and ſo bury them in a kind of Cheſt made in the form of a Laplandiſh Dray, as they do the bones of all other ſacrifices. But of this I ſhall ſpeak more at large when I come to their funeral rites, where the ſame things are likewiſe uſed. I ſhall only add that theſe rites are ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in <hi>Lapland</hi> by all that are ſuperſtitiouſly given. The <hi>Juhlii,</hi> whom they call <hi>Juhlafalket,</hi> as I ſaid of the ghoſts, have no ſtatues, nor images; the manner of worſhipping them is in this ſort. The day before the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival, which is Chriſtmas day, they abſtain from all fleſh: and of every thing that they eat, they take a litle piece and preſerve it very carefully, which they do likewiſe the next day. In their feaſting, the bits which they have gathered in theſe two days they put into a cheſt, made of the bark of Birch, in the faſhion of a Boat with ſails and oars, together with ſome fat of the pottage, and hang it upon a tree behind the Hut, about a bows ſhot off, for the <hi>Juhlii</hi> to feaſt on, whom they then ſuppoſe to wander in troops in the Air, thro woods and mountains; a ceremony not unlike to the ancient libations to the <hi>Genii.</hi> But why they do this in a Boat they can give no reaſon: but we may conjecture that hereby is intimated how the knowledg of Chriſts-birth (declared by the company of Angels, which as I have ſhewed already was the meaning of theſe <hi>Juhlii</hi>) was brought by Chriſtians, who came to them in Boats. So much of the <hi>Laplanders</hi> Idolatry and Superſtition, which remains to this day amongſt many of them, as is found by daily experience.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the magicall Ceremonies of the <hi>Laplanders.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT hath bin a received opinion among all that did but know the name of the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> that they are People addicted to Magic, wherefore I thought fit to diſcourſe next of this, as being one of the greateſt of their impieties that yet continues among them. And that this opinion may ſeem to be grounded upon ſome autority, they are deſcribed both by ancient and modern Writers, to have arrived to ſo great skill in enchantments, that among ſeveral ſtrange effects of their art, they could ſtop ſhips when under full ſail. This judgement of the Hiſtorians concerning the <hi>Laplanders</hi> is no leſs verified alſo of the <hi>Biarmi</hi> their predeceſſours. So that we may juſtly ſuppoſe both of them to have deſcended from the ſame original: for the <hi>Biarmi</hi> were ſo expert in theſe arts that they could either by their
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98689:29"/>looks, words, or ſome other wicked artifice, ſo enſnare and bewitch men, as to deprive them of the uſe of limbs and reaſon, and very often bring them into extreme danger of their lives. But tho in theſe latter times they do not ſo frequently practiſe this, and dare not profeſs it ſo publicly as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, being ſeverely prohibited by the King of <hi>Sweden:</hi> yet there are ſtill many that give themſelves wholly unto this ſtudy. But if we enquire into the motives and reaſons hereof, this, formerly mention'd, ſeems the principal, that every one thinks it the ſureſt way to defend himſelf from the injuries and malicious deſigns of others: for they commonly profeſs that their knowledge in theſe things is abſolutely neceſſary for their own ſecurity. Upon which account they have Teachers and Profeſſors in this ſcience: and parents in their laſt will bequeath to their children, as the greateſt part of their eſtate, thoſe ſpirits and devils that have bin any waies ſerviceable to them in their life time. <hi>Sturleſonius</hi> writes of <hi>Gunilda,</hi> a maid, that was ſent by her father <hi>Odzor Huide,</hi> who dwelt in <hi>Halogaland,</hi> to <hi>Motle</hi> King of <hi>Finlapland</hi> in <hi>Norway,</hi> to be inſtructed in this art. Where he gives an account alſo of two other <hi>Finlanders,</hi> and the great knowledg they attained to in this profeſſion. But it is very ſeldom that the parents themſelves are not ſo learned, as to perform the duty, and ſave the expences of a tutor. Thus they become famous in theſe ſtudies, eſpecially when they happen to be apt Schollars. For as the <hi>Laplanders</hi> do not all agree in the ſame diſpoſition, ſo neither do they arrive to the ſame perfection in this art. For ſome are ſo ſtupid and dull, that however they may ſeem quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for other emploiments, they prove altogether unfit for this.</p>
               <p>As to the bequeathing their familiars to their Children, they ſuppoſe it the only means to raiſe their family; ſo that they excell one another in this art, according to the largeneſs of the legacies they receive. From hence it is manifeſt, that each houſe hath peculiar ſpirits, and of different and quite contrary natures from thoſe of others. And not only each diſtinct family, but ſingle perſons in them alſo have their particular ſpirits, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one, two, or more, according as they intend to ſtand on the defenſive part, or are maliciouſly inclined and deſign to be upon the offenſive: ſo that there are a ſet number of obſequious ſpirits, beyond which none hath. But however ſome of theſe will not engage themſelves without great ſolicitation, and earneſt entreaties, when others more readily profer themſelves to litle children, when they find them fit for their turn, ſo that diverſe of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants are almoſt naturally Magicians. For when the devil takes a liking to any perſon in his infancy, as a fit inſtrument for his deſigns, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſeaſes on him by a diſeaſe, in which he haunts them with ſeveral apparitions, from whence according to the capacity of his years and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding he learns what belongs to the art. Thoſe which are taken thus a ſecond time ſee more viſions, and gain greater knowledg. If they are ſeaſed a third time, which is ſeldom without great torment, or utmoſt danger of their life, the devil appears to them in all his ſhapes, by which they arrive to the very perfection of this art; and become ſo knowing, that without the Drum they can ſee things at greateſt diſtances, and are ſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the devil, that they ſee them even againſt their will. For example, not long ſince a certain <hi>Lap,</hi> who is yet alive, upon my complaint againſt him for his Drum, brought it to me; and confeſt with tears, that tho he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98689:29"/>ſhould part with it, and not make him another, he ſhould have the ſame viſions he had formerly: and he inſtanc't in my ſelf, giving me a true and particuliar relation of whatever had happened to me in my journy to <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And he farther complained, that he knew not how to make uſe of his eies, ſince things altogether diſtant were preſented to them.</p>
               <p>As for the art, it is, according to the diverſity of the inſtruments they make uſe of in it, divided into two parts: one comprehends all that to which their Drum belongs, the other thoſe things to which knots, darts, ſpells, conjurations, and the like refer. Firſt concerning the drum, as being peculiar to the <hi>Laplanders;</hi> and called by them <hi>Kannus,</hi> or <hi>Quobdas;</hi> it is made out of a hollow piece of wood, and muſt either be of pine, fir, or birch tree, which grows in ſuch a particular place, and turns directly according to the Suns courſe; which is, when the grain of the wood, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the bottom to the top of the tree, winds it ſelf from the right hand to the left. From this perhaps they believe this tree very acceptable to the Sun, which under the image of <hi>Thor</hi> they worſhip with all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable devotion. The piece of wood they make it of, muſt be of the root cleft aſunder, and made hollow on one ſide, upon which they ſtretch a skin: the other ſide, being convex, is the lower part, in which they make two holes, where they put their fingers to hold it. The ſhape of the upper ſide is oval, in diameter almoſt half an ell, very often not ſo much; it is like a kettle drum, but not altogether ſo round, nor ſo hollow; neither is the skin faſtned with little iron ſcrewes, but wooden pegs. I have ſeen ſome ſowed with the ſinews of Rain-dears. <hi>Olaus</hi> termed the drum very improperly an anvil, tho I believe he only meant by this a drum, as will appear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. This perhaps made the Engraver miſtake, who made a Smith's anvil for it, placing a Serpent and a frog upon it, with a Smith's hammer by. The <hi>Laplanders</hi> uſe only a drum, which perhaps becauſe they beat it with a hammer, was by <hi>Olaus</hi> called an anvil. They paint upon the skin ſeveral pictures in red, ſtained with the bark of an Alder tree. They draw near the middle of the drum ſeveral lines quite croſs, upon theſe they place thoſe Gods, to whom they pay the greateſt worſhip, as <hi>Thor</hi> the chief God, with his attendance, and <hi>Storjunkar</hi> with his: theſe are drawn on the top of the line; after this they draw another line parallel to the former, only half croſs the drum, on this ſtands the image of Chriſt with ſome of his Apoſtles. Whatever is drawn above theſe two lines repreſents birds, Stars, and the Moon; below theſe they place the Sun, as middlemoſt of the Planets, in the very middle of the drum, upon which they put a bunch of brazen rings when they beat it. Below the Sun they paint the terreſtrial things, and living creatures; as Bears, Wolves, Rain-dears, Otters, Foxes, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents: as alſo Marſhes, Lakes, Rivers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is the deſcription of the drum according to <hi>Sam. Rheen,</hi> of which this is the picture.</p>

               <p>I have obſerved that ſeverall of their drums have not the ſame pictures upon them, I have three very different; one, which is here ſet down, marked by the letter B. They are deſcribed differently by <hi>Tornaeus,</hi> in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the figures are diſtinguiſhed ſo as to refer to ſeveral places, of which there are chiefly three. In the firſt ſtands <hi>Norland,</hi> and other Countries of <hi>Sweden,</hi> which are placed on the South ſide of the drum, and are ſeparated by a line from the reſt; in this alſo is contained the next great City, where they trafic moſt; as in the drums made at <hi>Torne,</hi> or <hi>Kiemi,</hi> there is drawn the City <hi>Torne,</hi> with the Temple, Prieſt, and Governour of the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> and many others with whom they have any concerns: as alſo the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that lies betwixt them and <hi>Torne,</hi> by which they diſcover when their Prieſt, or Governour will come; beſides other affairs managed in thoſe parts. On the North part, <hi>Norway</hi> is deſcribed with all that is contained in it. In the middle of theſe two ſtands <hi>Lapland,</hi> this takes up the greateſt part of the drum: in it are the ſeveral ſorts of beaſts that are in the Countrey, here they picture herds of Rain-dears, Bears, Foxes, Wolves, and all manner of wild beaſts, to ſignifie when, and in what place they may find them. If a tame Rain-dear be loſt, how they may get him againe. Whether the Rain-deers young ones will live. Whether their net fiſhing will be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfull. If ſick men will recover, or not. Whether women great with child ſhall have a ſafe delivery. Or ſuch, or ſuch a man will die of ſuch a diſtemper, or by what other; and other things of the like nature which they are deſirous to know. I cannot give an account of the reaſon for this difference in the drums, unleſs it is that ſome of them are made for more malicious deſigns, others again for each man's private purpoſe. Upon this account I believe, according to the nature of the buſineſs they intend, they add, and blot out, and ſometimes wholly change the figures. But that you may the better underſtand the diverſity of the drums, here are two repreſented to you, both which I had out of the Study of the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Kingdom.</p>

               <p>Now there are two things required to fit the drum for uſe, an Index and a Hammer, that ſhews among the pictures the thing they enquire after, with this they beat the drum. The Index is the bunch of brazen rings mentioned before. They firſt place one great ring upon the drum, then they hang ſeverall ſmall ones upon that; the ſhape of the Index's is very different, for of theſe I have one made of copper, of the bigneſs of a <hi>Dollar,</hi> with a ſquare hole in the middle, ſeveral ſmall chains hanging about it inſtead of rings. Another hath an Alchymy ring, on which a ſmall round plate of copper is hung by little chains. I have ſeen another alſo of bone, in the ſhape of the Greek Δ, with rings about it; and others
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98689:32"/>of a quite different make. I have deſcribed mine under the drums A, and B, by the mark G; but the common ſort of rings are of copper, and thoſe upon the Chancellors drums are altogether ſuch. Some Writers call theſe rings ſerpents, or brazen frogs, and toads; not that they reſemble them, but becauſe by them they ſignifie theſe creature, whoſe pictures they often uſe in their conjuring, as ſuppoſing them very grateful and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Devil. The <hi>Laplanders</hi> call the Index <hi>Arpa,</hi> or <hi>Quobdas;</hi> and make it indifferently of any ſort of metal. The hammer they uſe in raiſing their familiars, is not the Smith's; which was the errour of him that drew it in <hi>Olaus Magn.</hi> but is an inſtrument belonging only to the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> and called by a peculiar name by them: it is made of a Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deers horn, branching like a fork, this is the head of the hammer, the other part ſerves for the handle. The inſtrument is placed under the two drums A. B. with the letter H, with the hammer they beat the drum, not ſo much to make a noiſe, as by the drumming to move the ring lying on the skin, ſo as to paſs over the pictures, and ſhew what they ſought after. This is the deſcription of the drum, with all its neceſſaries as it is uſed by the <hi>Laplanders</hi> that are ſubject to the <hi>Swedes;</hi> the <hi>Finlappers</hi> alſo that are under the Crown of <hi>Danemarke,</hi> make uſe of drums ſomething diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in faſhion from the former; yet however the difference is ſo ſmall, that I believe their drums are not of a different kind from ours, but made only for ſome particular uſes. I ſhall give an account of one of thoſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>Wormius</hi>'s Study, who ſaies that the <hi>Laplanders</hi> drum, which they uſe in their magic, and by beating which they diſcover thoſe things they deſired, is made of an oval piece of wood hollowed, in length a foot, in breadth ten inches; in this they make ſix holes, and put a handle to it, that they may hold in the left hand, whilſt they beat it with the other; upon it they ſtretch over a skin, painted with diverſe rude figures, drawn with blood, or red; upon this lies a piece of braſs, in the ſhape of a Rhom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boides, ſcmewhat convexe, about two inches in diameter, in the middle of this, and at each corner hangs a ſmall chain. The inſtrument, with which they beat the drum, is of bone, ſix inches long, about the thickneſs of a little finger, and made much like the Latine T.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This inſtrument the <hi>Laplanders</hi> uſe for diverſe deſigns, and are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that whatever they do it is don by the help of this. For this reaſon they have it in great eſteem and reverence, taking ſuch care in ſecuring it, that they wrap it with the Index, and hammer, up in a Lambskin, and and for its greater ſafety, lay it in ſome private place. But I think it an errour, to ſuppoſe them to lay it in a Lambskin: for it is written in ſome places <hi>Loomskin,</hi> which ſignifies the skin of a bird that lives altogether in the water. They think it ſo ſacred, and holy, that they ſuffer no maid that is marriageable to touch it; and if they remove it from place to place, they carry it the laſt of all, and this muſt be don too only by men; or elſe they go with it thro ſome untrod way, that no body may either meet or follow them. The reaſon they give for their great care in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, is, becauſe they believe if any one, eſpecially a maid that is marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſhould follow the ſame way, they would in three daies time at leaſt fall into ſome deſperate diſeaſe, and commonly without any hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. This they ſeem to verifie by many examples, that we may give the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98689:33"/>more credit to it; and we have the leſs reaſon to doubt the truth of this, ſince the devil ſeverely commands his worſhip to be obſerved, and ſuffers not thoſe rites and cuſtoms he hath impoſed to be violated, ſo long as God is pleaſed to grant him this liberty. Now becauſe it may happen ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that a woman may out of neceſſity be conſtrained to go that way, by which the drum hath bin carried, the devil is ſo favorable as to permit it without any danger, upon condition ſhe firſt offers a brazen ring to the drum.</p>

               <p>Thoſe in the mean time that are preſent, leave not off ſinging all the time he lies ſweating in this agony; which they do not only to put him in mind, when he awakes, of the buſineſs he was to know; but alſo that he
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98689:34"/>recover out of this trance, which he would never do, (as they imagine) if they either ceaſed ſinging, or any one ſtirred him with their hand or foot. This perhaps is the reaſon why they ſuffer no flie, or any living creature to touch him; and it is upon this account only that they watch him ſo dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and not out of any fear they have leaſt the devil ſhould take away his body; which opinion of <hi>Peucers</hi> is altogether falſe. It is uncertain how long they lye in this manner, but it is commonly according as the place where they make their diſcovery, is nearer or farther off; but the time never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds 24 houres, let the place be at never ſo great a diſtance. After he awakes he ſhews them ſome tokens to confirm their belief in what he tells them. This is the firſt and chiefeſt uſe they make of the drum.</p>
               <p>The next is, how to know the event of their own concerns, and what ſucceſs their hunting will have, or any other buſineſs which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, for they ſeldom venture on any thing, without firſt conſulting that. In order to the knowing this, they place the bunch of rings on the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Sun in the drum; then they beat, ſinging at the ſame time; if the rings go round towards the right hand, according to the Suns courſe they promiſe to themſelves good health, fortune, and great encreaſe both of men and beaſts; if contrary, towards the left, they expect ſickneſs and all the evils attending on ill ſucceſs. We may eaſily ground this opinion of theirs upon the other mentioned above, where they believe the Sun the only Author of all productions. Wherefore when the Index moves according to his motion, it portends proſperity by following his courſe, from whom they expect all the good they receive. This is the way they take in all their more weighty affairs, as in a journey, hunting, removing their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations, or any ſuch like thing, of which ſomething before, and more hereafter. Before they hunt they make particular obſervation which way the Index turns, whether Eaſt, Weſt, North, or South; and collect from thence where their game lies. Other things for which the drum is ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable, are, firſt, the diſcovering the nature of diſeaſes, whether they ariſe from any diſorder in the body, or are cauſed by magic; this being known, then to find the remedy for them, which is commonly by ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to one or other of their angry Gods, but chiefly to <hi>Storjunkar,</hi> who bears greateſt autority among them, and if not appeaſed, leaves them ſmall hopes of recovery. Wherefore the ſick perſon vows a ſacrifice, either of a Rain-deer, Bull, Goat, or Ram, or ſomething of this kind to one of the <hi>Storiunkars,</hi> that ſtands upon the mountains. The ſacrifice is not left to the diſpoſal of the ſick man, but muſt be made according to the directions of the drummer; for he is ſuppoſed to be the only man able to adviſe them in this caſe, he firſt diſcovers which of the Gods is diſpleaſed, and what ſort of ſacrifice is moſt acceptable to him, for they refuſe ſeveral, and the ſame alſo at ſeveral times. But before the drummer appeaſes their Gods, they give him a copper and a ſilver ring, putting them on his right arm, then he begins a ſong, and beats the drum, and all that are preſent joyn with him in a <hi>Chorus;</hi> after this according to the place, to which the Index points, he directs them. Theſe are the things commonly done by the drum. The laſt thing for which they think it neceſſary, is, the accompliſhing their wicked deſigns, as impairing mens health, or depriving them of their lives; which is frequently enough practiſed among them, tho not altogether ſo
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98689:35"/>publicly as heretofore. Some of them account this only unlawful, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude themſelves out of the number of thoſe, which uſe it, thinking the other uſes of the drum to conſiſt chiefly in doing good. But however this miſchievous Art continues ſtill too much among them. Several inhabitants of <hi>Kiema</hi> in <hi>Lapland</hi> were apprehended in the year 1671, with drums, for this purpoſe ſo large, that they could not be removed from thence, but were burnt in the place. Among thoſe <hi>Laplanders</hi> there was one four ſcore years of age, that confeſſed he was bred up in this art from his childhood, who in 1670 upon ſome quarrell about a pair of mittens, cauſed a Boar of <hi>Kiema</hi> to be drowned in a Cataract, for which he was condemned to die, and in order to that was to be carried in chains to the next town in <hi>Bothnia,</hi> but in the journy he contrived ſo by his art, that on a ſuddain, tho he ſeemed well, and luſty, he died on the ſledge, which he had often foretold he would ſooner do, then fall into the Executioners hands. As to the ceremonies uſed in this particular, either in their words, geſture, or any other thing, I can give no account, finding none in thoſe writings, from whence I colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the reſt. The reaſon for this, I ſuppoſe, is, becauſe they themſelves keep this ſecret, as the great myſtery in their art; or that no one would enquire into them, leaſt they ſhould be thought guilty of this damnable ſin.</p>
               <p>Having treated largely of the drum, we come to the other parts of this art, to which alſo belong proper ſorts of inſtruments: the firſt is a cord tied with knots for the raiſing of wind. They, as <hi>Zeiglers</hi> relates it, tye three magical knots in this cord; when they untie the firſt, there blows a favorable gale of wind; when the ſecond, a brisket; when the third, the Sea and wind grow mighty ſtormy, and tempeſtuous. This, that we have reported concerning the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> is by <hi>Olaus Magnus,</hi> and juſtly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated of the <hi>Finlanders,</hi> who border on the Sea, and ſell winds to thoſe Merchants that trafic with them, when they are at any time detained by a contrary one. The manner is thus, they deliver a ſmall rope with three knots upon it, with this caution, that when they looſe the firſt, they ſhall have a good wind, if the ſecond, a ſtronger, if the third, ſuch a ſtorm will ariſe, that they can neither ſee how to direct the ſhip, and avoid rocks, or ſo much as ſtand upon the decks, or handle the tackling. No other Writers mention this concerning the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> and I am apt not to think it at all probable, ſince they live in an inland Country, bordering no where upon the Sea. Wherefore this properly belongs to the <hi>Finlappers</hi> in <hi>Norway.</hi> Now thoſe that are skilled in this art, have command chiefly over the winds that blew at their birth; ſo that this wind obeys principally one man, that another, as if they obtained this power when they firſt received their breath; now as this belongs chiefly to the <hi>Finlappers</hi> and <hi>Finlanders</hi> of <hi>Norway,</hi> ſo doth the ſtopping of the courſe of ſhips, which is altogether of the ſame nature. This is alſo attributed to the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> who according to the different affection they have for Merchants, make the Sea either calmer, or more tempeſtuous.</p>
               <p>We come now to their magical Darts, which they make of lead, in length about a finger; by theſe they execute their revenge upon their enemies, and according to the greatneſs of the injury received, they wound them with cankrous ſwellings, either in the arms, or legs, which by the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of its pain, kills them in three daies time. They ſhoot theſe darts
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98689:35"/>to what diſtance they pleaſe, and that ſo right too, that they ſeldom miſs their aim. <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> reports the ſame in his writings, which I believe is only a tranſcript of <hi>Zeigler</hi>'s, the words being the ſame, and without doubt he follows him in this particular as he hath in many others. But I ſuppoſe they are both miſtaken, and miſrender'd them leaden darts, ſince I can find no perſon in theſe times that knows of any ſuch; neither is there any mention made of them in any other writers, or by the common People, who ſeldom omit ſuch circumſtances as theſe in their relations. But they might perhaps be miſtaken in ſuppoſing them to be made of lead, by mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding the word <hi>Skott,</hi> which is commonly uſed for their expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. For when either man or beaſt is ſuddainly taken with a diſeaſe, by which their ſtrength fails, and they immediately periſh; the common People call this that takes them ſo <hi>Skott,</hi> that is a dart. This might make <hi>Zeigler</hi> think to be really ſome dart, which the inhabitants are wholly ignorant of, and moſt among us believe theſe things to be effected by ſome other means. <hi>Petrus Claudius</hi> calls it a <hi>Gan,</hi> which they ſend abroad: he likens it to a flie, but ſaies it is ſome little devil, of which the <hi>Finlanders</hi> in <hi>Norway</hi> that excell moſt in this art, keep great numbers in a leathern bag, and diſpatch daily ſome of them abroad. Of theſe he relates a ſtory, that happened in his time: an Inhabitant of <hi>Helieland,</hi> who is ſtill alive, going towards the mountains in <hi>Norway</hi> to hunt Bears, came to a cave under the ſide of a hill, where he found an image rudely ſhapen, which was the Idoll of ſome <hi>Finlander;</hi> near this ſtood a <hi>Ganeska,</hi> or magical ſatchel: he opened this, and found in it ſeveral blewiſh flies crawling about, which they call <hi>Gans,</hi> or ſpirits, and are daily ſent out by the <hi>Finlanders</hi> to execute their deviliſh deſigns. But he ſeems to intimate no more by this word <hi>Gan,</hi> then that very thing which endangers mens health, and lives. For he ſaies that theſe <hi>Finlanders</hi> cannot live peaceably, except they let out of their <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eska</hi> or <hi>Gankiid,</hi> which is the fatchel, every day one of the <hi>Gans,</hi> that is a fly or devil. But if the <hi>Gan</hi> can find no man to deſtroy, after they have ſent him out, which they ſeldom do upon no account at all, then he roves about at a venture, and deſtroies the firſt thing he meets with; ſometimes they command it out to the mountains, to cleave rocks aſunder: however theſe conjurers will, for very trivial cauſes, ſend out their <hi>Gan</hi> to ruine men. This word <hi>Gan</hi> ſignifies no more then what <hi>Zeigler</hi> meant by his dart, for the term by which they expreſs its going out is <hi>de Skiuda deris Gan,</hi> that is, he as it were ſhoots out his <hi>Gan</hi> like an arrow, for <hi>Skiuda</hi> is only proper to the ſhooting out of an arrow.</p>
               <p>This is the third thing belonging to their magic, which they uſe as well againſt one another as ſtrangers; nay ſometimes againſt thoſe that they know are their equals in the art. Of this kind there happened a notable paſſage betwixt two <hi>Finlanders,</hi> one of which was called <hi>Asbioern Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konge,</hi> from his great knowledge in the art, the other upon ſome ſmall difference concerning their skill, or ſome ſuch trifle, would have deſtroyed <hi>Asbioern,</hi> but was ſtill prevented by his too powerfull art, till at laſt finding an opportunity, as <hi>Asbioern</hi> lay ſleeping under a rock, he immediately diſpatcht away a <hi>Gan,</hi> that cleft the rock aſunder, and tumbled it upon him. This happened in the time of <hi>Petrus Claud.</hi> not long before he wrote his Hiſtory. Some of the Conjurers are contented only with the power to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98689:36"/>expell that <hi>Gan</hi> out of men, or beaſts, which others ſend. This is remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable among them, that they can hurt no man with their <hi>Gan,</hi> except they firſt know his parents name.</p>
               <p>Now all that the <hi>Finlanders</hi> and <hi>Finlappers</hi> of <hi>Norway</hi> effect by their <hi>Gan,</hi> the <hi>Laplanders</hi> do by a thing they call <hi>Tyre.</hi> This <hi>Tyre</hi> is a round ball, about the bigneſs of a wallnut, or ſmall apple, made of the fineſt hair of a beaſt, or elſe of moſs, very ſmooth, and ſo light that it ſeems hollow, its colour is a mixture of yellow, green, and aſh, but ſo that the yellow may appear moſt. I had one of theſe given me by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>John Otto Silverſtroem,</hi> Warden of the Colledge belonging to the metals, and Maſter of the Mines at <hi>Saltzburg</hi> and <hi>Frahlune.</hi> This is the figure of it.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>This <hi>Tyre</hi> they ſay is quickened and moved by a particular art? it is ſold by the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> ſo that he that buies it may hurt whom he pleaſes with it. They do perſwade themſelves, and others, that by the <hi>Tyre</hi> they can ſend, either Serpents, Toads, Mice, or what they pleaſe into any man, to make his torment the greater. It goes like a whirlewind, and as ſwift as an arrow, and deſtroies the firſt man, or beaſt, that it lights on, ſo that it often miſtakes. Of theſe we have too many inſtances in this time, which are too long to inſert here: having therefore done with all, or at leaſt the chiefeſt matters concerning their ſacred, and ſuperſtitious rites, or worſhip; we proceed to other affairs.</p>

               <p>WE come now to their ſecular affairs, which are either public or private: we will treat firſt of the public, to which belong the form and conſtitution of their Government.

               <p>Their condition was not much altered, after that they took this name, which was when they firſt ſent out Colonles into the inland Countries, on the farther part of the mountains, which divide <hi>Swedland</hi> from <hi>Norway.</hi> For they that went out had certainly ſome Leader, whom without doubt they choſe for King, after they had taken poſſeſſion of thoſe Countries; and I believe they would ſcarcely ſubmit to any other power whilſt that he was living; and this ſeems the more probable, becauſe no one in thoſe daies would undertake the conqueſt of a company of poor beggarly fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives, who dwelt among Woods and Deſerts, in continual ſnow and the greateſt extremity of cold. This was the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> opinion of them, who tho they dwelt near them, ſcarcely knew their nature and diſpoſition, and thought it madneſs to ſet upon them with a ſmall party, and an adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of little profit, and leſs honour to raiſe an Army againſt a Country already diſtreſſed by poverty. For this reaſon the <hi>Laplanders</hi> enjoied their own cuſtoms for a long time. The firſt King of <hi>Sweden</hi> that had any thoughts of conquering them was <hi>Ladulaus</hi> the great, who floriſhed about the year 1277, who becauſe it ſeemed difficult to bring them under the Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi> promiſed thoſe that would undertake the conqueſt, the government over them. He thought it too expenſive to make a public war upon them, when they were to be dealt with as wild beaſts; yet however could not endure that a neighbouring People, dwelling almoſt in the heart of his Country, for they poſſeſſed at that time as far as the Bay of <hi>Bothnia,</hi> ſhould refuſe obedience to his Kingdom. Wherefore he thought upon the before mentioned project, and propoſed great advantages to private perſons, upon which the <hi>Birkarli,</hi> their neighbours, readily engaged themſelves, and effected their enterprize no leſs ſucceſsfully. In this deſign, the plot of a particular perſon was moſt remarkable, as is related by <hi>Ericus,</hi> and recorded by <hi>John Buraeus.</hi> One ſingle man of the <hi>Birkarli</hi> went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Lapland</hi> to way-lay the <hi>Laplanders</hi> in their return from <hi>Birkala,</hi> (at this time no one inhabited on the North ſide of that allotment) and ordered his wife to cover him over with ſnow, in the middle of the way where the <hi>Laplanders</hi> muſt neceſſarily paſs over him. They came in the night time, and by their paſſing over him he knew there were fifteen, which were the chief among them, and to whom the reſt were in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; when they were gone, he immediately aroſe out of the ſnow, and going ſome ſhorter way, ſet upon them at unawares, as they paſſed by, one by one, which is their uſual way in travelling, and ſlew them one after another. None of thoſe that followed perceived the firſt men ſlain, it being in the night time, and each of them at ſome diſtance from the others; till the laſt man finding his fellows killed, made a ſtout reſiſtance, but the <hi>Birkarla</hi> by the aſſiſtance of his wife got the victory, and ſlew him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Thus the moſt powerfull of them being ſlain, the reſt readily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Some think the <hi>Birkarli</hi> deluded them by a pretended truce, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98689:37"/>that before it was expired, they aſſaulted them, not ſuſpecting then the leaſt danger, and killing ſeveral, ſubdued the Countrey, as far as the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern and Weſtern Oceans. We may eaſily collect from the truce mentioned here, that before their ſubjection to the <hi>Swedes</hi> by the <hi>Birkarli,</hi> there was ſome kind of war betwixt both: beſides, it was ſhewn above, that <hi>Ladulaus</hi> could not bring them under his Crown. This perhaps may be <hi>Zeiglers</hi> meaning, when he deſcribes them as a warlike People, and free for a great time, that they alſo withſtood the Arms of <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> till they were forced at laſt to yeild; but what <hi>Zeigler</hi> imputes to their valour, proceeded only from the contemt they were then in, as is plain from the opinion the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> gave of them. And there is little reaſon to ſuppoſe the <hi>Swedes</hi> were not of the ſame, ſince they were overcome only by the allotment of <hi>Birkala;</hi> and <hi>Ladulaus</hi> did not conquer them out of any fear he conceived of their forces, but by ſleight, foreſeeing the ſmall advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages he ſhould receive would not quit the charges of an Army. Thus the <hi>Laplanders</hi> were brought in ſubjection by the ſubtilty and expence of private perſons. About the year of our Saviour 1277, the <hi>Birkarli</hi> had the autority over them; yet ſo as to acknowledg their dependance on the King of <hi>Sweden.</hi> Now whether all of them were thus overcome, as thoſe that lived beyond the mountains of <hi>Norway,</hi> near the Sea, which are the <hi>Finlanders,</hi> or <hi>Lappofinni,</hi> is ſtill in doubt, except we collect it from this, that all from the Northern and Weſtern Oceans were certainly ſubjected. But whatever diſpute may ariſe concerning that, it is manifeſt the <hi>Swedes</hi> were the firſt Conquerours of <hi>Lapland,</hi> but afterwards the <hi>Norwegians</hi> and <hi>Moſcovites</hi> following their example, put in alſo for a part; thus they became ſubject to theſe three ſeverall Princes. But to paſs by the others, the <hi>Swedes</hi> enjoyed, for ſome former ages, half the dominions from <hi>Tidis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiorden</hi> to <hi>Walangar,</hi> over the <hi>Lappofinni,</hi> or maritime <hi>Finlanders.</hi> This was given by <hi>Charles</hi> the IX, in his inſtructions to his Embaſſadors, ſent to the King of <hi>Danemark,</hi> wherein he made it appear that the <hi>Swedes</hi> had from former times, till then, enjoied half the rights, both ſacred and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, whether as to tributes, puniſhments, men, or fiſherie, with the Crowns of <hi>Danemark</hi> and <hi>Norway.</hi> But the <hi>Swedes</hi> kept only a third part from <hi>Malanger</hi> to <hi>Waranger,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Moſcovy</hi> laying claim to the other two, till in the year 1595, the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> by a League, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up their part, but the <hi>Swedes</hi> alwaies poſſeſſed the mountainous and more neighbouring places from <hi>Ladulaus</hi>'s time, for near four hundred years, and exerciſed their autority over them. The Government after the conqueſt was in the hands of the <hi>Birkarli,</hi> according to the grant given them by <hi>Ladulaus,</hi> who ruled over thoſe that dwelt near the Bay of <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> impoſed taxes, trafficked with them, and received all the profit of the Salmon fiſhing, and all other advantages ariſing from them; but in acknowledgement to the King, as Supreme, they paid a certain number of gray Squirrils skins. The <hi>Laplanders,</hi> by common conſent, received and honored the <hi>Bergchara,</hi> that is men of the mountains, or <hi>Birkarli,</hi> as their Governours, and paid them very rich skins, and ſeverall ſorts of fiſh, both for their tribute to the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and their own proper uſes. Neither were there any other commiſſioned by the King in thoſe times to govern them, as will appear afterwards. He, that was their Governor was
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98689:37"/>honored by them with the title of King, his autority was confirmed by the Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi> he wore a red robe, as the token of his Roialty; now from this ſort of garment, by which the <hi>Birkarli</hi> were diſtinguiſhed from others, it is evident they were the firſt rulers in thoſe parts; and perhaps only one governed them, whilſt they dwelt near the Bay of <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> but when they enlarged their poſſeſſions farther into the Land, and were divided into ſeverall Counties, each diviſion had its particular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor. And that it was ſo, is manifeſted from the Letters of <hi>Guſtavus</hi> the firſt, where he divides the <hi>Birkarli</hi> into <hi>Luhlians, Pythians,</hi> and <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> over which accordingly there were ſeverall Governors. It may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps now be a diſpute, who theſe <hi>Birkarli</hi> were, by whom the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſubdued <hi>Lapland; Buraeus</hi> ſaies they were the Inhabitants of the allotment, of <hi>Birkala,</hi> but <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> is of a different opinion, and calls them <hi>Bergchara,</hi> that is, men of the mountains, from <hi>Berga</hi> mountain, and <hi>Charar</hi> or <hi>Karar</hi> men. What grounds he hath for this, he neither declares, nor can I eaſily imagine. But I think them ſo ſmall that they will find little credit any where; for from whence, or from what mountains ſhould they be thus called? not from thoſe of <hi>Norway,</hi> when at that time no body inhabited there; neither are there any other mountains beſides theſe, from whence they ſhould take this name: moreover, the <hi>Birkarli</hi> were ſubjects to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and converſed commonly with the <hi>Laplanders.</hi> The public records alſo contradict this opinion, for in them there is no mention of <hi>Bergcharli,</hi> but <hi>Birkarleboa.</hi> It is yet clearer alſo from the Letters of <hi>Cnute Joanſon,</hi> written in Latine, in the year 1318, where he ſaies in the Parliament held at <hi>Telge,</hi> betwixt the <hi>Helſingers</hi> and <hi>Birkarleboa</hi> in his preſence, there was iſſued out this Placart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This ſerves to confute <hi>Olaus.</hi> It is more evident that they came from <hi>Birkala,</hi> an allotment in <hi>Tavaſtia,</hi> and deſcribed in the Mapps. Next, as to <hi>Guſtavus</hi> the firſt mentioning the <hi>Birkarli,</hi> in the foreſaid Letters, as belonging to ſeverall marches, <hi>viz. Luhla, Pitha,</hi> and <hi>Torna</hi> it was upon this account: the <hi>Birkarli</hi> that deſcended from thoſe of <hi>Tavaſtia,</hi> were placed in theſe ſeverall Towns to govern the <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> and becauſe they only had the priviledge of commerce with them, they were called Merchants. They were uſed in the Summer to buy thoſe commodities of the Merchants that came to <hi>Bothnia,</hi> which were neceſſary for the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> and in the Winter, when the Rivers and Lakes were frozen over, they carried them up into the Countrey. This way of trafic was uſed by all the Inhabitants of <hi>Bothnia,</hi> but perhaps only at firſt by one allotment, which growing populous, ſeverall of the Inhabitants removed farther into the Countrey, and retained the ſame priviledge that was firſt granted by <hi>Ladulaus, viz.</hi> that no one, but they, ſhould claim any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges over the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> either as to the Government, tribute, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, or any thing of this nature, which priviledges they for a long time enjoied, as is confirmed by the Letters wrote by <hi>Cnute Joanſon,</hi> in the time of King <hi>Smecke,</hi> in which it was provided that the <hi>Birkarli</hi> ſhould not be moleſted either in their paſſage to or from the <hi>Laplanders.</hi> This privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they maintained till <hi>Guſtavus</hi> the firſt, who made a Contract with them at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal</hi> on the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1528, concerning the yearly tribute they were to pay to the Crown, for the great advantages they received from the <hi>Laplanders.</hi> This tribute was only in reſpect of the priviledges the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98689:38"/>
                  <hi>Birkarli</hi> had from <hi>Ladulaus</hi>'s time till then, theſe were ſo largely granted, that they ſetled them as hereditary upon their children, and none but thoſe deſcended from the <hi>Birkarli</hi> could enjoy them. This <hi>Guſtavus</hi> alſo confirmed according to the former grants made to their anceſtors, but with this alteration that they ſhould pay half as much more, as they did formerly. This Government the <hi>Birkarli</hi> exerciſed over the <hi>Laplanders</hi> which they got by ſubtility, had their autority from the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> preſerved it in their own family, and delivered it down to their children for near 300 years, till <hi>Guſtavus</hi> the firſt, by reaſon of their inſulting over the common People, deprived them of this ſtate; for when their riches encreaſed they oppreſſed the poorer ſort, and extorted ſo much from them that they left them very little, but that which was worth nothing. Upon this, complaint was made to <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> who thereupon committed <hi>Henricus Laurentii</hi> to priſon, and confiſcated moſt of his eſtate, taking then the tribute from the <hi>Laplanders</hi> into his hands, and granted to all People free trading with them. This <hi>Henricus Laurentii</hi> was without doubt in that time the head of the <hi>Birkarli,</hi> and I believe the brother of <hi>David Laurentii,</hi> who, together with <hi>Jonas Nicolas,</hi> concluded the Treaty with <hi>Gustavus</hi> in the name of the <hi>Birkarli,</hi> in the year 1528, for ſetling the tribute, and other affairs. From hence we may collect they loſt their priviledges, not long after this Contract; now it was not only juſt to deprive them of thoſe priviledges, which they abuſed in oppreſſing others, but prudent, as well from the jealouſy of too great a power granted to private perſons over ſo large and populous a part of the Kingdome, as out of conſideration of its wealth, which was more neceſſary to the Kings, for driving out the common enemy, ane eſtabliſhing the Kingdomes liberty, then to maintain the pride of the <hi>Birkarli,</hi> who beſides their injuſtice, were inconſiderable both in number and ſtrength. <hi>Guſtavus</hi> the firſt having thus depoſed the <hi>Birkarli,</hi> ſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties to gather the tribute, and manage all things in the Kings name; the Deputies are called by the <hi>Swedes, Lappfougder,</hi> by the <hi>Laplanders, Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunga Olmai,</hi> that is the Kings men; of theſe there is mention made in the patent granted by <hi>Guſtavus</hi> the firſt to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Michael,</hi> the firſt Prieſt in <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in 1559, the words are to this purpoſe, <hi>We command all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of</hi> Lapland, <hi>as well Deputies, as others,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe had at firſt the charge of all public affairs, as will appear in the following Chapter, as for collecting taxes, as executing juſtice among them. But afterwards, when <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth divided the Countrey into ſeveral parts, and formed it into better order, more were added to the former, for examining cauſes, convicting of criminals, and other ſuch like things, till at laſt the ſtate of Government was little different from what it is now. Next under the King, they have a Provincial Judge called by the <hi>Swedes, Lagman,</hi> under him one of the Senators, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderlagman,</hi> next an Interpreter of the Laws, <hi>Lag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeſaren,</hi> and divers others which enquire into cauſes, and do juſtice; then they have a Governour of the Province, <hi>Landzhoefdingh,</hi> a head over the <hi>Laplanders, Lappafougten,</hi> their Officers who perform all other duties. In this manner the <hi>Laplanders</hi> are now governed by the <hi>Swedes.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of the Judicatures and Tributes of the <hi>Laplanders.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AFTER the manner of their Government, and the diſcipline they live under, we deſcend to thoſe affairs that are managed by it; which belong either to the Courts of Judicature, or to the Tribute. I can ſcarce find any mention of the former. Their own Kings, when they were a free Nation, exerciſed this autority, and kept the juriſdiction in their own hands; but when the <hi>Birkarli</hi> ruled them, it depended altogether on their pleſure. <hi>Zeigler</hi> makes no mention of any Judges among them, but ſaies that if any diſpute happened that was dubious, it was referred to the Courts in <hi>Swedland;</hi> I ſuppoſe he means the more weighty controverſies, which the <hi>Birkarli</hi> could not, or did not dare to decide. But theſe were very rare with them, for great crimes, as theft, rapine, murder, adultery, or ſuch like are ſeldom committed, and ſcarce known by the <hi>Laplanders.</hi> They neither borrow nor lend mony, being content with what they poſſeſs of their own, which are commonly the occaſions of quarrels in other Nations, and maintain ſo many Lawyers. The chief ſin they are guilty of, is their magical ſuperſtition, which ſince their embracing Chriſtianity, is forbidden by the Laws, and is not ſo frequent as formerly. After that <hi>Guſtavus</hi> the firſt had depoſed the <hi>Birkarli,</hi> and given them governors of their own, they lived under better diſcipline, and greater diligence was uſed in ſeeing Juſtice done, but <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth was the firſt that took care to have them inſtructed in the Swediſh Laws, and that they ſhould regulate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves accordingly. This charge was given by the ſame King in his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to <hi>Laurentius Laurentii,</hi> Governor of <hi>Lapland,</hi> dated from <hi>Stockholm</hi> on the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of Oct. 1610, wherein he commanded him to govern thoſe of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ma, Pitha,</hi> and <hi>Luhla,</hi> according to the Swediſh Laws, and to protect them from all injuries. There are at preſent in <hi>Lapland</hi> three Governors, and as many Courts of Judicature; the firſt is called <hi>Anundſioeenſe,</hi> or <hi>Anger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſian,</hi> the other <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>hmenſian, Pithenſian</hi> and <hi>Luhlenſian,</hi> the other is the <hi>Tornenſian,</hi> and <hi>Kiemenſian.</hi> Over theſe are particular Governors, who in the Kings name paſs Sentence, but in the preſence of a Judge and a Prieſt; where it is obſervable that they added Prieſts to the Governors, to reſtrain them from doing injuſtice by the autority of their preſence. Now as to the time when theſe Courts were called, it is a doubt, but I believe it was at the Fair times, when they met about all public buſineſs; this was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly twice in a year, <hi>viz.</hi> in Winter and Summer, according to an order of <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth's. It is now in <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February.</hi> They were held in the ſame places where they kept their Markets and Fairs, which were determined in each particular County, as will appear by and by.</p>

               <p>Now we come to the Tribute they paid, which at firſt was only skins of beaſts, paid not by the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> but the <hi>Birkarli,</hi> yet only as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of their ſubjection to the Crown of <hi>Sweden. Buraeus</hi> calls it <hi>naogra timber graoskin, graoskin</hi> ſignifies gray Squirrils skins, of which color the Squirrils were conſtantly in the Winter; <hi>timber</hi> denotes the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the skins, which were fourty, tied together in a bundle. It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain how many of theſe bundles the <hi>Birkarli</hi> gave, but in the Contract with <hi>Guſtavus</hi> the firſt, thoſe of <hi>Luhla</hi> and <hi>Pitha</hi> were engaged to pay 8, which makes in all 360 skins, beſides two Martins skins. Thoſe alſo of <hi>Torne</hi> were taxed with the ſame number; and ſhortly after this number was doubled, by an agreement made in 1528. But after the <hi>Birkarli</hi> had loſt their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, for the forementioned reaſons, and the King received the tax by Commiſſioners for himſelf, it is very probable ſome more alteration were made. In the year 1602 they paid inſtead of skins every tenth Rain-deer, and one tenth of all their dried fiſh; which is clear from the commands given by <hi>Charles</hi> tc-his Deputies <hi>Olaus Burman</hi> and <hi>Henry Benegtſon,</hi> at <hi>Stockholm</hi> on the 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>July</hi> in the ſame year, to require the tribute in this manner, that ſo the <hi>Laplanders</hi> might know what and how much they were to pay: for it ſeems that from <hi>Guſtavus</hi> the firſt's time, till then, the Governors uſed no conſtant method in raiſing it, but ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded skins, at other times other ſorts of goods that ſeemed moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for preſent uſe; ſo that by this uncertainty the tribute grew very heavy upon the Inhabitants, and their Governors took occaſion from it to exact what they pleaſed under pretence of the public account, for their own proper uſes. Yet this cuſtom continued not long, being thought perhaps too burthenſome to the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> and very prejudiciable to their herds; wherefore it was ordered in 1606, that every one which was then 17 years of age, ſhould pay either two Bucks, or three Does out of their herds of Rain-deers, and eight pound of dried fiſh; as alſo every tenth Fawn out of their ſtock, and every tenth tun from their fiſhery. This tax was alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on the <hi>Birkarli</hi> that had any trafic with them. This order was kept a long while, and renewed again by the ſame King in 1610. The tribute they pay at this time is either mony, Rain-deers, or skins, either plain or fitted up for uſe. Theſe they pay according to the largeneſs of the Provinces in which they dwell, the largeſt of which, they ſay, are <hi>een heel skatt,</hi> that is, they pay the full tribute; the leſſer <hi>een half skatt,</hi> that is, half tribute; and ſo likewiſe for the reſt. He that poſſeſſeth a Province of the whole tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, pays two <hi>Patacoons,</hi> which they call <hi>Skattadaler,</hi> and others that have leſſer poſſeſſions and half tribute, give one <hi>Patacoon;</hi> thoſe which want mony, pay fiſh or skins, which are commonly of Foxes or Squirrils, of theſe 50, of the others one with a pair of <hi>Lapland</hi> ſhoes, are equal to a <hi>Patacoon:</hi> two pounds alſo of dry fiſh are of the ſame value; now to every pound of dried fiſh they allow five over, becauſe ſo much is commonly loſt in the drying. They call this pound with its addition <hi>Skattpund,</hi> that is the pound for tribute. They value their Rain-deers at 3 Dollars a piece, and pay the tenths of them, not each family, but every hundred. I have ſet the prices down here, becauſe if any one had rather keep his Cattel, he can be forced to no more then after this rate. Now concerning the tenths they pay of skins, every houſholder is taxed one white Foxe's skin, or a pair of <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:98689:41"/>ſhoes; if he hath neither of theſe, half a pound of dried Jack. This is the Tribute yearly received by the Crown of <hi>Sweden</hi> from <hi>Lapland,</hi> of which the greateſt part is commonly by the Kings gracious favor allowed for the maintenance of their Prieſts, as was ſhewn in another place. Now becauſe it is ſo far both by Sea and Land, before theſe commodities can be brought to the Kings Storehouſes, beſides the ordinary tax they give a pair of <hi>Lapland</hi> ſhoes, which they call <hi>Haxapalka,</hi> that is the price for carriage. This is all they pay to the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> but beſides they are tributary to the Crown of <hi>Danmark,</hi> and the great Duke of <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> not as Subjects to theſe Princes, but upon the account of their receiving ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral advantages from their Dominions in their hunting and fiſhing. Thoſe that are thus, are all the allotments of <hi>Torna</hi> beyond the mountains, who by reaſon of the liberty they have to bring down their Cattel from the mountains into the vallies in the Summer time, near the Sea ſhore, and taking the opportunity from thence of fiſhing, are taxed by the <hi>Danes,</hi> but not at above half the rate that they pay to the <hi>Swedes.</hi> Theſe allotments are called <hi>Koutokeine, Aujouara, Teno,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tziocki.</hi> The <hi>Laplanders</hi> alſo of the allotment of <hi>Lnare</hi> in <hi>Kiemi,</hi> are in the ſame condition, who for fiſhing and hunting pay both to the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Moſcovites</hi> as well as to the <hi>Swedes:</hi> to the firſt one half, to the other a third part of what the <hi>Swedes</hi> receive. The tribute was in former time gathered when the Governor pleaſed, but afterwards only in the Winter, againſt which time it was all brought into Storehouſes, each County having its proper place for that purpoſe. But when the place for their Markets and Fairs was determined, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor came thither and received it, which courſe they ſtill take in this buſineſs. That this was alſo the time for receiving it, will appear from the account I ſhall give of their Fairs in the next Chapter.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Of the <hi>Laplanders</hi> Fairs, and Cuſtoms in Trading.</head>
               <p>THAT we may not yet leave the Public concerns of the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> of which we have treated, let us proceed in the next place to conſider their Fairs and common Markets, in which what Cuſtoms they anciently uſed is not ſo well known. <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> ſaies that among the <hi>Laplanders</hi> he that had any thing to ſell, after he had expoſed his Wares, went his way and left them, and that the Chapman coming, and taking what was for his turn, left in the place the full value thereof in white furrs or skins. The reaſon why they did not ſpeak and bargain with their Chapmen, he ſaies was, becauſe they were a ruſtic People, extreamly fearful, and ready to run away from the very ſight of a ſhip, or ſtranger. Others, that are of a more probable opinion, confeſs indeed that they uſed no words in their trading, but that it was not out of ruſticity, want of cunning, or the like;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98689:42"/>but becauſe they had a language quite different from others, and ſo pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to themſelves, that they could neither underſtand, nor be underſtood of their neighbours: ſo that it was rather the barbariſm, and roughneſs of their ſpeech, then manners, that made them uſe this dumb way of traffiking, But of their language we ſhall treat in its proper place.</p>
               <p>Concerning their trading with their neighbours, it is moſt certain that it was performed without words, by nods and ſilent geſtures: neither was it properly a buying and ſelling (for they did not of old uſe either gold or ſilver) but rather an exchange of one commodity for another. So that whereas <hi>Zieglerus</hi> tells us they did <hi>permutatione &amp; pecunia commercia agere,</hi> we may juſtly doubt whether it be not rather to be read <hi>nec pecunia,</hi> (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs happily he intend <hi>pecunia</hi> in the primary ſenſe, and hath more reſpect to the original of the word, then to the acception now in uſe.) And truly this way of exchange among them, in thoſe ancient times, was no leſs then neceſſary; when indeed, as well the neighbouring Countries, as the <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> were quite ſtrangers to any current mony; and this we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand from the <hi>Swedes,</hi> among whom there were in thoſe daies either no coins at all; or elſe only ſuch as had bin tranſported out of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> the uſe of the Mint being then utterly unknown in that Country. And if at that time there was no mony in <hi>Swedland,</hi> it is certainly no great wonder there ſhould be none in <hi>Lapland.</hi> But neither in after times, and when they were under the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Birkarli,</hi> could the <hi>Laplanders</hi> come to the uſe of mony; for they that were Lords over them, monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing the whole trade to themſelves, did not give them mony for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, but ſuch other merchandiſe, as their Country ſtood in need of. In fine to this very day the <hi>Laplanders</hi> know no other mony but the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacoon</hi> and half <hi>Patacoon;</hi> other coins whether of copper, ſilver, or gold, they do not ſo much value, which will give us to underſtand that the uſe of mony among them cannot be of any long date, for the <hi>Patacoon</hi> is but of later daies, and was never known before the diſcovery of the Mine in the Vale of <hi>Joachim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Patacoons</hi> they value ſingly at 2 onces of ſilver a piece, whence it appears that as they had no other mony, ſo neither did this paſs currant among them, but only by weight, and as if it were in the Maſs: and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive was not at all in uſe, untill they were forced to pay tribute in that kind, of which I have diſcourſed before, and ſhewed that it was but of late inſtituted. But what <hi>Damianus</hi> means by his <hi>permutatione tantum anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam &amp; pecuniam acquirunt,</hi> we cannot ſo eaſily gueſs; for we do not ſay that men barter and deal by exchange when mony is paid for a commodity: for to what end ſhould thoſe People ſeek after getting mony, which was in uſe neither among themſelves nor their neighbours; ſo that perhaps here alſo we ought to read <hi>nec pecuniam,</hi> and then the ſenſe runs, that they were not ſo ſollicitous in getting mony, as in providing the more neceſſary things of life: altho neither is that true which he delivers of their proviſions, as will appear from what follows.</p>
               <p>But whatſoever <hi>Damianus</hi> means, it is moſt certain that in all their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce they did but exchange one thing for another; and that to this day the ſame cuſtom remains among them, who are now concern'd for no more mony then what is ſufficient to pay their tribute. Only if there is any commodity
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98689:42"/>among them of great and extraordinary value, that indeed is to be bought with mony.</p>
               <p>Their cuſtom is now, not as formerly, to bargain by ſigns and nods, but either they uſe ſpeech, (for there are many of them now that are skilled in that of their neighbours) or Interpreters, of which there are plenty enough among them. They with whom they trafic are for the moſt part their neighbours, on the one ſide the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Norwegians,</hi> on the other the <hi>Finlanders, Ruſſians,</hi> and <hi>Moſcovites.</hi> Neither was it otherwiſe in old times, unleſs when they were under the power of the <hi>Birkarli,</hi> who endeavouring to get all the trade into their own hands, did more narrowly watch thoſe that were nigheſt <hi>Sweden,</hi> that ſo they might exclude all but themſelves from trafficking in any part of <hi>Lapland.</hi> The power that we read was given the <hi>Birkarli</hi> over the <hi>Laplanders</hi> by <hi>Ladulaus</hi> the great King, I ſuppoſe, chiefly conſiſted in this; for the other ſpeciall rights and priviledges, which they and their anceſtors for a long time poſſeſſed, <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtavus</hi> the firſt hath ſet down, as I have in another place declared.</p>
               <p>And this we may alſo gather from the prohibition of <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, denying the <hi>Birkarli</hi> the priviledge of trafficking in <hi>Lapland,</hi> as they had formerly done. The words of the injunction publiſhed in the year 1602 are to this purpoſe; <hi>And we do utterly forbid the</hi> Birkarli <hi>any more to trade for skins or other commodities, as they have formerly uſed.</hi> Before this time therefore they were either the only, or chief Merchants in <hi>Lapland,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when they had brought their merchandiſe, they went round the Country purchaſing all the skins they could, of which afterwards they made great ſums of mony. And this they continually did till the time of <hi>Gustavus</hi> the firſt, when that priviledge began to be denyed them; by which they were grown ſo rich and powerfull, and what is the common conſequent thereof, proud and haughty.</p>
               <p>But neither could <hi>Gustavus</hi> provide againſt all their arts and evaſions; for tho he took from them all power over the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> yet they being better skilled in the commodities of the Country and conſtitution of the People then others, did ſtill, tho not ſo openly, keep correſpondence and trafic with them, till in the year 1602, in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, they were forbid by the forementioned injunction, at any time, or in any place, to hold any commerce with them, and the monopoly of all skins was annext to the Crown; a certain rate being ſet at which they were to be ſold. The words of the Edict are thus: <q rend="inline">Whatſoever skins are found in <hi>Lapland,</hi> we do command and enjoyn our Governors to buy up for our uſe, according to the ſtatute and rate in that caſe provided.</q> And this was alſo again enforced in the year 1610, only in this there was a clauſe inſerted, that the skins of <hi>Elkes</hi> ſhould be brought into the Kings treſury <hi>gratis.</hi> The clauſe runs thus: <q rend="inline">And we do command all <hi>Laplanders</hi> in our name to bring to our Governors all ſaleable skins, for which they ſhall return the worth in other commodities, as is by ſtatute provided; but the skins of <hi>Elkes</hi> they ſhall ſeize upon for our uſe, not giving any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration for them; if any man ſhall take this beaſt, it ſhall be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him to keep the fleſh for his own private uſe, but the skin ſhall belong to Us and our Crown.</q> But their trading is now grown more general, and they have of late years learned to deal more freely and openly
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98689:43"/>with other Nations; for they that dwell among the mountains that divide <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Swedland,</hi> deal both with the <hi>Norwegians</hi> and <hi>Swedes,</hi> and they that live more Northerly and Eaſterly with the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> and <hi>Finlanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I come to the commodities themſelves, which <hi>Jovius</hi> ſaies are only white skins, or furrs, called <hi>Ermines. Zieglerus</hi> reckons fiſhes alſo, of which they have ſo great draughts, that they are forced to keep them in trunks and ponds till they can tranſport them into <hi>Northbothnia</hi> and <hi>Ruſſia alba.</hi> But there are ſeveral other ſorts of skins, which <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends under a more general term, and calls <hi>pelles pretioſas. Sam. Rheen</hi> gives us this catalogue of them, the commodities of the <hi>Laplanders</hi> are, Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deers, skins of Raindeers, skins of black, yellow, blew, white Foxes; skins of Otters, of <hi>Gluttons,</hi> or Badgers, of Martins, of Beavers, of Squirrils, of Wolves, and of Bears, Laplandiſh garments, Boots, ſhoes, Gloves, dried Pike, and Cheeſes of Rain-deers. With theſe commodities the <hi>Laplanders</hi> traffic for Silver, Patacoons, Wollen and linnen Cloth, Copper, Alchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Salt, Corn, Bulls hides, Sulphur, Needles and Pins, Knives, Spirit of Wine, and which is more ſtrange for Tobacco, of which as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are great admirers.</p>
               <p>Upon all theſe things as was but now declared, there was a certain rate ſet by <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, according to which they were to be bought up for the uſe of the Crown; and the ſame cuſtom is ſo far yet obſerved, that to this very day, with whomſoever they deal, they have a certain eſtimate, whereby they prize both their own and others commodities: the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which rates is according to the Patacoon, or which is the ſame thing with them, 2 ounces of ſilver. For example, an ordinary Rain-deer they value at 2 Patacoons, or 4 ounces of ſilver, the skin of a wild Rain-deer at one Patacoon and ½, or 3 ounces of ſilver; the skin of a tame male Rain-deer at one Patacoon, but if caſtrated, at ¾ of a Patacoon, and if a female at ½. So likewiſe an ordinary Fox skin is worth a Patacoon, 40 gray colored Squirril skins are valued at the ſame price, which number of thoſe skins they call <hi>timber.</hi> The skin of a Martin at the ſame price, 3 white Fox skins at the ſame price, a Bears skin is worth 2 Patacoons, and a Wolves skin as much, an ordinary Laplandiſh garment, which they call <hi>Mudd,</hi> is worth 3 Patacoons, a pair of Boots half a Patacoon, and 4 pair of ſhoes, 4 pair of gloves, and one pound of dried Pike, each of them are valued at the ſame price.</p>
               <p>Now on the other ſide, of the commodities for which they traffic, an ell of ordinary cloth, commonly called <hi>Sileſian</hi> or <hi>Tangermyndenſe,</hi> they eſteem at the rate of a Patacoon, or 2 ounces of ſilver; 3 pound of Copper at the ſame rate, and one tunn of corn at 2 Patacoons and ½, or 5 ounces of ſilver, 2 pound of Salt at ½ of a Patacoon, 10 yards of courſe cloth, ſuch as we call <hi>home-ſpun,</hi> and they call <hi>Waldmar,</hi> is worth a Patacoon, a Can of ſpirit of Wine half as much; but if they chance to light upon any commodities of a lower price, they value them by gray colored Squirril skins, proceeding from one to 10, which number of skins they call <hi>Artog,</hi> and value at ¼ of a Patacoon, and theſe are the commodities that drive the trade between the <hi>Swede</hi> and <hi>Laplander.</hi> But to thoſe of <hi>Norway</hi> they carry all ſorts of coverlets, made of the skins of Rain-deers, alſo the beaſts themſelves, their skins and cheeſes, and the ſeathers of Birds; moreover
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98689:43"/>thoſe things for which they trade with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> are Copper and Alchimy veſſels, ordinary cloth woven by the Swediſh Boors, theſe they change for Bulls, and Cows, whoſe milk they live on in the Summer, and on their fleſh in the Winter, alſo for Goats and Sheep, out of whoſe skins they make themſelves coverlets, for ſilver, for the skins of black Foxes, and Otters, for woollen blankets, and for fiſh, which they ſell again to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> as Herrings, dried Codfiſh, Skails, and ſuch like. <hi>Johannes Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> comprehends them in a ſhorter catalogue, the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> ſaies he, traffic with thoſe with <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Bothnia,</hi> Subjects of the Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi> for ordinary woollen cloth, linnen cloth of both ſorts, as well the fineſt as courſeſt, for corn, bread, braſs, iron, and all ſorts of Country utenſils. But above all things it was their chiefeſt care to get beaſts out of <hi>Norway,</hi> which in the Autumn, they uſed to Sacrifice to their Idols.</p>
               <p>Whether there were anciently any ſet places or times in which they did trade, I cannot certainly pronounce, tho <hi>Olaus Magnus,</hi> Lib. 4. Cap. 5. ſeems to affirm it, and ſaies, there were certain ſet places, ſome in open fields, and ſome upon the Ice, in which they did every year keep their Fairs, and exhibit to the public view what they had by their own induſtry gained, either at home or abroad. But for all this he proceeds not to tell us where thoſe Fairs were kept, or where thoſe places were. And <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth forbidding the <hi>Birkarli</hi> continually, and at all times to make their circuits round the Gountry, did nevertheleſs appoint certain times and places, in which, as at public Fairs, all traffic ſhould be free and open as well to them as others. The words of the Edict publiſhed in the year 1602 I will give you, which run thus: <q rend="inline">Wherefore ſeeing we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden the <hi>Birkarli</hi> to trade in <hi>Lapland,</hi> according to their old cuſtom, and in manner aforeſaid, We do will and command to be appointed two Fairs every year in every Province, one in the Winter, the other in the Summer, as it ſhall ſeem moſt convenient, and We do will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand our Governors to take care that certain fit places be looked out, in which theſe Fairs may be kept, and to appoint ſet times, at which moſt conveniently as well all <hi>Laplanders, Birkarlians, Moſcovites,</hi> as others, may reſort unto them. Furthermore our Will and pleaſure is, that each Fair laſt for two or three weeks, during which time, it ſhall be lawfull for every one to make ſuch bargains as may be moſt for his own profit. And we do alſo command our Governors, that certain Boothes and Sheds be provided after the moſt convenient manner.</q> Now by all this it may appear that in former times there were no ſuch things either obſerved or known, ſeeing the King here ſpeaks of them as firſt inſtituted by him; neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in the Edict it ſelf doth he ſet down any certain time or place, but names them only as things intended, and which he leaves to the diſcretion of his Governors, which alſo <hi>Andr. Buraeus</hi> ſeems to intimate was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, when he ſaies that when they were to pay their tribute, they were at a certain time and in certain places gathered together, as into a <hi>Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,</hi> where thoſe Merchants, we before called <hi>Birkarli,</hi> exhibited their wares. But now he alſo leaves us in the dark as to a certainty either of time or place, ſo that it may ſeem theſe Fairs and conſtitutions did not find ſo good ſucceſs as it was hoped they would, untill at length the Queen <hi>Christina</hi> taking the buſineſs into conſideration, brought it to greater
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98689:44"/>perfection. There is an Edict of hers, publiſhed in the year 1640, in which two Fairs are appointed, one at <hi>Arfwisjerf</hi> in <hi>January,</hi> the other at <hi>Arieplog</hi> to be kept in <hi>February.</hi> The words are to this purpoſe: <q rend="inline">Furthermore We have given and granted, and by theſe preſents do give and grant 2 ſolemn Fairs, one at <hi>Arfwisjerf</hi> on the Feaſt of the Converſion of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> being the 25 of <hi>Jan.</hi> the other at <hi>Arieplog</hi> on the Feaſt of the Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the B. V. <hi>Mary,</hi> being the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> each to be held for 3 daies, at which times it ſhall be lawfull for the <hi>Pithenſes</hi> and all <hi>Laplanders</hi> to exerciſe all ſorts of traffic, and theſe Fairs ſhall firſt be holden the next year 1641.</q> From this time they began to be more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently obſerved, and are kept upon thoſe Feaſts to this very day, for in all Provinces there are every Spring 3 Fairs kept; the firſt in <hi>Lapmarkia <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> upon the Feaſt of the <hi>Epiphany,</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> in <hi>Lapmarkia Luhlenſis</hi> on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> the laſt in <hi>Lapmarkia Pithenſis, Tornenſis,</hi> and <hi>Kimenſis</hi> on the Feaſt of the <hi>Purification.</hi> Theſe are the Fairs which <hi>Chriſtina</hi> inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, only that in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>menſis</hi> I beleive was obſerved from the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, and the rather becauſe that <hi>Lapmark</hi> is nigheſt <hi>Swedland.</hi> Into <hi>Norway</hi> they reſort and keep Fairs twice a year, the firſt at Midſummer on the Feaſt of S. <hi>John,</hi> the other in the Autumn on the Feaſt of <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Jude,</hi> or <hi>All-Saints</hi> day. And ſo much for the times and places of their Fairs.</p>
               <p>As for their way of dealing they were of old in all their bargains very faithfull and juſt, tho <hi>Damianus a Goes</hi> ſeems to note ſome craftineſs in them, and ſaies they were very cunning in all their tradings. And <hi>Sam. Rheen</hi> in plain terms call them cheats, and ſaies they were ſo deceitful, that one that did not know all their tricks, could hardly eſcape being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reached by them. So that we may ſuppoſe that as long as others dealt fairly with them, ſo long they were truſty and faithfull, but in after times coming to learn how others had ſerved them, by underſtanding how they had been cheated formerly, they themſelves learned to deceive others. But of this we have ſpoken before: and theſe thing may ſerve to give us ſome light into their cuſtoms in trafficking.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of the Language of the <hi>Laplanders.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN the former Chapter we told you that the Language of the <hi>Laplanders</hi> was ſuch as did very much differ from that of their neighbours, our next buſineſs ſhall be, as well as we can, to diſcover what it is. Now what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is received, uſed, commonly, and publikly ſpoken in any Country is certainly a Language, but of this of the <hi>Laplanders, Zieglerus</hi> in general obſerves only that it was peculiar to themſelves, and not underſtood by their neighbours. <hi>Damianus</hi> ſpeaks more plain, and accuſes them of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſm and roughneſs of ſpeech. Our modern Writers ſay their ſpeech is a confuſed miſcellany of the Language of their neighbours, and that it was
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98689:44"/>called <hi>Lingua Lapponica,</hi> quaſi <hi>corraſa, eet Lappatſpaock,</hi> and that it is made up of many other Tongues, as of that of <hi>Finlanders</hi> and <hi>Swedes,</hi> as for inſtance; the <hi>Laplanders</hi> ſay <hi>ſtour,</hi> the <hi>Swedes, ſtoor;</hi> the one <hi>Salug,</hi> the other <hi>ſaligh.</hi> And that there are alſo ſome Latine words, as <hi>Porcus, Oriens,</hi> &amp;c. But tho theſe Writers ſuppoſe that they have borrowed many words from their neighbours, yet they confeſs that much of their Language is their own, and neither uſed, or known by any other Naitons, but that as well the original of the words, as propriety of the Phraſes, is peculiar to themſelves. Others ſuppoſe it took its riſe and was derived from <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> and indeed it is confeſſed on all hands that there are many words in both Languages that ſeem no great ſtrangers. So that there is little doubt but there are many words in both Languages which very much agree, which any one that is a little skilled in them muſt needs confeſs: and to make this more clear, I ſhall here inſert ſome words of both Languages not much unlike.</p>

               <p>Theſe words I ſuppoſe may ſerve to declare the affinity that we ſaid was between the Language of the <hi>Laplanders</hi> and <hi>Finlanders:</hi> and becauſe the words that I have ſet down, do not ſignify any forreign commodities, but things natural, and ſuch as are in uſe among all People alike, I am given to belevie that the <hi>Laplanders</hi> had not any peculiar Language, which did wholy differ from that of <hi>Finland,</hi> but that it took its original thence. For if, as ſome would have it, they had any Language, they might properly call their own, why did they not out of it, upon things of ſo common oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence and ordinary uſe, rather impoſe their own words, then ſuch as no man could doubt were taken from the <hi>Finlanders.</hi> No People certainly were ever guilty of ſo much folly as to impoſe forreign names upon ſo common things, if they had any Language of their own to expreſs them in: as might be at large demonſtrated from the Languages of the <hi>Germans,</hi> ancient <hi>Gaules, Spaniards, Italians, Greeks,</hi> &amp;c. neither have we any reaſon to count it a hard inference if we ſhould from hence gather, that the <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> themſelves ſprung from the <hi>Finlanders.</hi> For otherwiſe why ſhould they have uſed any other Language then what they received from their fore-Fathers. And this ſeems to be the argument <hi>Wexonius</hi> uſes to prove the Language of the <hi>Laplanders</hi> to have taken its riſe from the <hi>Finlanders,</hi> when from the original of the People he infers the ſame of the Speech; for in this he intimates that to ſpring from any Country, and to uſe the ſame Language, are very convertible propoſitions. All which indeed ſeems to be no more then the truth. But now ſome one may object that the opinion of thoſe men that affirm the Language of this Country to be primarily its own, could not be deſtitute of all reaſon, and that they muſt neceſſarily have had ſome probabilities whereon they grounded their opinion; and truly it cannot be denied but that there are many words which do not any waies agree with the Language of the <hi>Finlanders,</hi> as may appear from what follows,

               <p>And the Difference between theſe and the like words without doubt was that which gave occaſion to ſome to think that anciently the <hi>Laplanders</hi> had a Speech peculiar to themſelves, and quite different from that of <hi>Finland,</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:98689:45"/>of which ancient Language theſe relicts did remain, and for this they give this reaſon; that the <hi>Laplanders</hi> were forced to frame to themſelves a new Language, for fear, leaſt being underſtood by their neighbours the <hi>Finlanders,</hi> they ſhould fall into their ſnares. So <hi>Olaus Petri</hi> ſaies that often times they found ſpies about their tents in the night, hearkning after their Councels, now for this reaſon, according to the Policy of their Forefathers, flying into the allotment of <hi>Rengo,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Nolnenſe,</hi> they there agreed upon, and framed to themſelves a Speech quite different from that of <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> So that there are very few words found to agree in both Languages. Now by the Spies he there talks of, he underſtands the <hi>Finlanders,</hi> who being driven out of their Country by <hi>Matthias Kurkius</hi> and the <hi>Tavaſtians,</hi> roved up and down, ſeeking where they might moſt conveniently ſettle, as may appear from what goes before in that place. Others think that theſe are the relicts of that Language which they firſt brought into <hi>Lapland,</hi> which they ſuppoſe to be no other but that of the <hi>Tartars.</hi> But how falſe this is, may appear from the vaſt difference between thoſe Tongues, in which there is not one word that ſignifies the ſame thing in both Languages. And that you may not think I ſay this without any reaſon, I will give you a few inſtances.</p>

               <p>And indeed there is as great incongruity in all the reſt of the words as in theſe, ſo that this opinion is not only fooliſh, but ridiculous. And neither is the other, which pretends they framed a Language to themſelves, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon any greater truth then this former. For firſt why ſhould they only have changed ſome words and not all? And then theſe words which do agree in both Languages are not the names of things leſs known, or not ſo ordinarily uſed, as other things, but of ſuch as were as common as life, light, or breathing: wherefore I am clearly of the other opinion, and do beleive that theſe differing words are as much Finnonick as any of the reſt. But they who from the difference of theſe words infer the independency of the Speeches, do not at all conſider that, then which there is nothing more common and incident to Languages, <hi>viz.</hi> to be changed and altered according to the times, and ſo much the more by how much the People have greater commerce with other Nations. And this is plain from the example of the <hi>Iſlanders</hi> and <hi>Norwegians;</hi> for that the <hi>Iſlanders</hi> ſprung from the <hi>Norwegians</hi> is by the Hiſtories of both Nations made ſo clear that no man can doubt of it. But now the <hi>Iſlanders</hi> uſe many words which thoſe of <hi>Norway</hi> are quite ignorant of; and yet I hope no man will thence ſay that the <hi>Iſlanders</hi> have a Language wholly independent and different from that of <hi>Norway:</hi> for the one living by themſelves, and having little or no dealings with other People, do to this day keep entire the ſame Language which they firſt brought, and which they received down from their anceſtors: but it was quite otherwiſe with the <hi>Norwegians,</hi> who together with their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire loſt alſo their ancient Language. The ſame ſeems to be the caſe of the <hi>Finlanders,</hi> who being brought under the Juriſdiction of others, and holding more frequent commerce with their neighbours, loſt much of their ancient manner of ſpeaking, which the <hi>Laplanders</hi> on the contrary living a more ſolitary life, it is probable, do ſtill keep uncorrupt. Wherefore it is no wonder if in their language we meet with many words, which compared with thoſe of the modern <hi>Finlanders,</hi> ſeem to have nothing of likeneſs; tho happily one that is well skilled in the dialect and propriety of the Finno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Language, will find enough to make him conjecture that there are many words which, as they are now uſed ſeem quite different, yet are very agreeable in the original. And this is likewiſe the common fate of other lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, as for example of the <hi>German,</hi> in which a little too raſhly the learned <hi>Olaus Wormius</hi> in his <hi>literatura Runica,</hi> as he calls it, Cap. 27, hath taken notice of ſo great a difference. For in theſe daies not only <hi>nach,</hi> but <hi>effter</hi> is uſed, as may appear <hi>affterred, afterdam</hi> &amp;c. And ſo likewiſe the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> uſe not only <hi>Geſicht,</hi> but alſo <hi>Antlitz;</hi> not only <hi>Verſtand,</hi> but <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunfft;</hi> and as well <hi>eſſen, anfangen, Schuſſ, Alter, Gefaengnus, auffthun, Bett, Dopff,</hi> &amp;c. as, <hi>As, beginnen, keimen, uralt, haffte, entdecken, Laegerſtad, locken,</hi> in all which they agree with the ancient <hi>Germans.</hi> In my opinion therefore the difference of a few words, is not authority enough to prove that the <hi>Laplanders</hi> in ancient times had a peculiar language. But it ſhews rather that they are not all of the ſame antiquity, but that ſome came from <hi>Finland</hi> longer ago, who brought thoſe obſolete words with them, and ſome of later daies, who now uſe the new; and this I think to be the beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Language of the <hi>Laplanders.</hi> Of which this alſo is obſervable, that it doth not in all places alike agree with it ſelf, but hath its ſeveral
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98689:46"/>different Dialects, and is ſo various, that thoſe that live in one part of the Country, can ſcarce underſtand thoſe of the other. There are eſpecially three Dialects, the firſt uſed by the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>menſes</hi> and <hi>Pithenſes</hi> in the Weſt, the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> by the <hi>Luhlenſes</hi> in the North, the laſt by the <hi>Tornenſes</hi> and <hi>Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſes</hi> in the Eaſt. And the variety of theſe Dialects was doubtleſs cauſed by the difference of times in which they came into <hi>Lapland;</hi> ſome coming ſooner, ſome later, ſome ſettling in one part, ſome in another. Now of all theſe Dialect, there is none more rough or unpleſant then that of the <hi>Luhlenſes,</hi> who as well in their life and manners, as in their way of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are far the moſt ruſtick and clowniſh of all the <hi>Laplanders.</hi> But that you may ſee what a diſparity there is between theſe Dialects, I will ſet down a few example: the <hi>Pithenſes</hi> ſay <hi>Jubmel,</hi> the <hi>Tornenſes, Immel,</hi> the <hi>Pithenſes</hi> ſay <hi>Jocks, Warra, Olbmo, niſw, skaigki, kiiſt, niſſu, pardei, ſeibig, muriet, reppi;</hi> for which the <hi>Tornenſes</hi> put, <hi>virte, taodar, almai, kab, kawtza, raopka, kaap, alik, owre, kops, riemnes.</hi> Now as the Language of the <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> is varied according to the diverſity of the Territories and Marches, juſt as it is in other Nations, particularly in <hi>Germany,</hi> where the <hi>Swave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, Saxons,</hi> and <hi>Belgians,</hi> ſpeak all different tongues, ſo hath it this alſo common with other Countries, <hi>viz.</hi> that the nigher the Territory tends to any other People, ſo much the more do the Iuhabitants participate of their Language; and ſo the <hi>Tornenſes</hi> and <hi>Kimenſes,</hi> who border upon the <hi>Finlanders,</hi> do at this day uſe very much of their ſpeech: nay they go yet farther, and make it their buſineſs to learn the Language of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, ſo the <hi>Tornenſes</hi> and <hi>Kimenſes</hi> get the <hi>Finnonik,</hi> the <hi>Luhlenſes, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſes,</hi> and eſpecially the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>menſes</hi> the Swediſh Language; and that man that is skilled in theſe Tongues hath not little conceit of himſelf, and is indeed much eſteemed among his neighbours. It is therefore no wonder if there be many Swediſh words found among the <hi>Laplanders:</hi> for it could not otherwiſe happen but that this People, who were ſupplied by others in many things which they had not themſelves, ſhould with Forreign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities receive alſo and uſe Forreign names; and of this I could give many inſtances, but it is not the buſineſs in hand. Now of this kind we ought to eſteem theſe words following; in <hi>Lapland, Salug</hi> ſignifies <hi>bleſſed,</hi> which the <hi>Swedes</hi> call <hi>Saligh: Niip</hi> a knife, the <hi>Swedes</hi> call it <hi>kniif; Fiaelo,</hi> a rafter with the <hi>Swedes tilio,</hi> and many more of the like nature. Of all which the R. and learned <hi>Johan. Tornaeus</hi> gives this account, that the uſe of Forreign words was introduced partly by neceſſity, and partly by converſing with Strangers; and upon this account it is that they that converſe with the <hi>Swedes</hi> do oftentimes uſe Swediſh words. The like may be ſaid of thoſe that deal with the <hi>Finlanders,</hi> and with the <hi>Germans</hi> in <hi>Norway;</hi> and this is the reaſon why one and the ſame thing is often called by divers appellations, as for example, the <hi>Swedes</hi> call a Horſe <hi>Haeſt,</hi> the <hi>Finlanders, Hapoitz,</hi> the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Roſs,</hi> which alſo is the name the <hi>Laplanders</hi> give the beaſt, for they having no Horſes of their own were forced to borrow a name from the Country from whence they had them. Now what <hi>Tornaeus</hi> obſerves concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word <hi>Roſs,</hi> I beleive may be applyed alſo to the word <hi>Porcus,</hi> which I ſuppoſe they had rather from the <hi>Germans</hi> then <hi>Latines,</hi> for the <hi>Germans</hi> call a Barrow-Hog, <hi>Bork,</hi> now their Swine they had all out of <hi>Norway,</hi> and it is very probable they did thence borrow that appellation alſo. And not
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98689:47"/>to trouble our ſelves any farther, this will hold true in all the reſt of that kind. Wherefore ſetting apart other conſiderations, and looking upon this Language, not as it contains in it forreign words, but only ſuch as they alwaies uſed within themſelves, and were ever received among them, it remains that we conclude it to be not a miſcellany or collection of Latin, German, Swediſh ſcraps, and the like, neither as a peculiar ſpeech, different from them altogether, but ſuch as originally took its riſe from the <hi>Finlanders,</hi> tho time hath brought it to paſs that perhaps few of them underſtand it.</p>
               <p>This Tongue, as well as others, hath its Declenſions, Compariſons, Conjugations, Moods, Tenſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and perhaps it may not be amiſs if I ſhould here inſert ſome examples: I will therefore firſt decline you a Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landiſh Noun, and afterwards give you the Finnonick Declenſion of the ſame, that by comparing both you may better underſtand the parity and diſparity of theſe Languages. This Noun ſhall be <hi>Immel,</hi> for ſo the <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſes</hi> call it, tho other ſay <hi>Jubmel,</hi> the <hi>Finlanders</hi> terms it <hi>Jumala,</hi> and it ſignifies <hi>God.</hi>

               <p>Theſe will ſerve to give us ſome light into the nature of this Language, at leaſt as much as is to our purpoſe, who did not undertake to write a Grammar, but only give ſome ſmall deſcription.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Laplanders</hi> have a peculiar way of pronouncing words, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which it is impoſſible to expreſs them in letters, for they do mouth out all their words, ſo that the vowels might be heard loud enough, but the other letters come very ſoftly out; they do alſo quite out off and drown the laſt Syllables, eſpecially of Nouns. Letters they neither have, nor ever had any, and in this they agree with their anceſtors the <hi>Finlander:</hi> the Calendar which they uſe, is no other but the Swediſh in <hi>Runick</hi> letters. And this alſo, before they came to have commerce with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and had learned of them the obſervation of Holy-daies, was never in uſe among them. <hi>Johannes Burous</hi> tells us that he heard from perſons of good credit, of certain grave-ſtones and monuments, which had ſometimes bin found in <hi>Lapland</hi> (more where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of perhaps might be found) on which were engraved <hi>Runick</hi> Characters. But ſuppoſe we this true, it is not, I hope, therefore neceſſary that we ſhould conclude that theſe were formerly the letters of the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> to which indeed, as well themſelves as their forefathers the <hi>Finlanders</hi> are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually Strangers. But we have more reaſon to think that the <hi>Swedes</hi> coming thither in ancient times, either by force of arms, or otherwiſe, inhabited there abouts, and left thoſe ſtones. To this day both the <hi>Laplander</hi> and <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi> uſe the Latine letter; in the ſame Character the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Germens</hi> make them, altho the number of them that can read among them is but very ſmall, and of them that can write, a great deal leſs, and are only ſuch as they call great Scholars.</p>
               <p>Now this Speech being only uſed among the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> and there being none that deſire to learn it but themſelves, in all negotiations with others, they are forced to uſe the help of Interpreters, of whom upon this account there are great numbers, as I have formerly ſaid: tho theſe Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters ſpeak all Languages, but the <hi>Finnonick,</hi> very barbarouſly, which is alſo the fault of all <hi>Laplanders,</hi> who are very hardly brought to learn or pronounce any other Tongue, and much given to confound one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So that they which traffic in <hi>Norway,</hi> and border upon that Country, do in their ſpeaking mingle together the Speech of the <hi>Norwegians</hi> and <hi>Swedes,</hi> as for inſtance, <hi>jeghkiaemi,</hi> for <hi>jag kom, jeg gaong,</hi> for <hi>jag goar.</hi> So for <hi>hustro,</hi> they ſay <hi>koona,</hi> for <hi>min myſsa, mitt hofwud,</hi> &amp;c. But of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the <hi>Laplanders</hi> let this ſuffice.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Of the Houſes of the <hi>Laplanders.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HITHERTO we have treated of the <hi>Laplander</hi> as he hath relation to the Common-wealth, we ſhall in the next place ſpeak of him as a private perſon. And this we ſhall do firſt, conſidering the things they have need of. Secondly, their imployments. And thirdly their leaſure and paſtimes. All neceſſary accommodations are either ſuch as are to defend us from ill inconveniences, or to give us neceſſaries. Of the firſt ſort, are Houſes and Cloathes, of the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, Meat and Drink. We ſhall begin with their houſes, or places of aboad. The <hi>Laplanders</hi> have not any houſes like other Northern People, it having bin their cuſtom to wander up and down, and ſo, ſometimes in one place and ſometimes in another, to ſet up ſmall ſheds for their preſent uſe: ſo that they had no certain habitations, but having eaten and conſumed the fiſh and beaſts in one place, they march to another, carrying their ſheds or tents with them.</p>
               <p>But this liberty of wandring up and down the Country, was in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Edict forbid them by <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, in the year 1602, and a certain place of habitation aſſigned to every family. The words of the Edict are to this purpoſe: <q rend="inline">We do in the firſt place command that in every <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> an account be taken of all Fenns, Rivers, Lakes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and who they are that have hitherto had the benefit and uſe of them, with the names of all ſuch: and then that the number of the families be compared with that of the Rivers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo equally divided that one family ſhall not poſſeſs more Rivers and Fenns then are for its uſe. Laſtly every <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> being thus divided, it ſhall be committed to honeſt and good men, who, without either favor or prejudice, ſhall aſſign to every family its juſt portion: and thenceforth it ſhall not be lawfull for any <hi>Laplander,</hi> at his pleſure to wander up and down all marches, as hath formerly bin uſed.</q> From the time of this Edict the <hi>Laplanders</hi> had their certain bounds and limits aſſigned them ſufficient for the ſuſtaining of their families. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it afterward lawfull for any one to invade the propriety of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, or to wander where he pleaſed.</p>

               <p>The 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> thing we are to note in theſe ſheds, is that they ſtrew their floors with branches of Birch trees, leaſt by the rain they ſhould be wetted, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98689:51"/>they uſe no other kind of pavement; only upon the boughs, for cleanlineſs ſake, they lay skins of Rain-deers, on which they ſit and lie. And theſe are the dwelling houſes of the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> beſides which they have alſo Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes in which they keep their commodities, eſpecially fleſh, fiſh, and ſuch other proviſions; theſe they call <hi>Nalla,</hi> and make thus: they cut the upper part of a tree off, ſo that the body remain four or five ells from the ground high, upon this trunk they place two rafters in the figure of an X, or S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Andrews</hi> Croſs, and upon theſe they build their repoſitory, making a door to it, and covering it with boards. There is one thing peculiar to theſe Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, which is, that the door is not in the ſide, but bottom of them, ſo that when the <hi>Laplander</hi> is come down, the door falls too, like a trap-door, and all things are ſafe. To theſe they go up by ladders which they make of the trunks of trees, in which they cut great notches like ſtairs. Now the reaſon why they place them ſo high, is becauſe of the Bears and other wild beaſts, who oftentimes pull them down, and to the great dammage of the Maſter eat all his proviſion; they uſed alſo to cut off the bark of the tree, and anoint the ſtock, ſo that neither mice nor wild beaſts could be able to climb up for ſlipperineſs. And perhaps theſe are the houſes <hi>Olaus magnus</hi> meant, when he ſaid, they placed their houſes upon trees for fear of wild beaſts. But that you may the better conceive theſe Store-houſes alſo, I ſhall here give you the Figure of them.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> Of the Garments of the <hi>Laplanders.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AMONG the <hi>Laplanders</hi> the men and women wear different kinds of Garments, which they alter according to the Weather, and place: for they wear one ſort of clothes in the Winter, and another ſort in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, one kind at home, and another abroad. Let us firſt conſider the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the men: Theſe in the Summer have trouſes, or brougs, reaching down to their feet, cloſe to their body, upon which they wear a gown, or rather a coat with ſleeves, which comes down to the middle leg, which they tie faſt with a girdle. And in this reſpect it was that <hi>Zieglerus</hi> in his time wrote, that they uſed cloſe Garments fitted to their body, leaſt they ſhould hinder their work. He calls them cloſe becauſe of their trouſes, and fitted to their body becauſe of their being girded. Theſe they wear next their bare skin, without ſuch linnen ſhirts as the <hi>Europeans</hi> uſe, they having no flax in their Country. Theſe Garments are of courſe home-ſpun woollen cloth called <hi>Waldmar,</hi> of a white or gray color, ſuch as the wool is of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is dyed. The wool they have from <hi>Swedland,</hi> and buy it of the Merchants called <hi>Birkarli,</hi> but the richer ſort wear a finer cloth, and not of the ſame color, but ſometimes green or blew, and ſometimes red, only black they abominate. Tho ſometimes in dirty works, and at home they wear the meaneſt clothes, yet abroad, and eſpecially upon Feſtivals and Holydaies, they love to go very neat. Their girdles are made of leather, which the richer ſort adorn with filver ſtuds, and poorer with tin. Theſe ſtuds ſtick out like buttons in a ſemicircular figure. At this girdle they hang a knife and ſheath, and a kind of ſquare bag, tho ſomething longer then broad, alſo a leathern purſe, and then a caſe with needles and thred in it. Their knives they have from <hi>Norway,</hi> the ſheath is of the skin of the Rain-deers, ſewed together with tin wire, and in other parts with the ſame adornments, at the end of which they uſe to hang rings: the bag is alſo made of the skin of the Raindeers, with the hair on it, on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of which they alſo place another skin, equall to the bag, and make it faſt by three knots, and this skin they cover again with red cloth, or of ſome other color, adorned alſo with wire. In this bag they keep a ſtone to ſtrike fire, not of flint, but chriſtall, as I will ſhew hereafter. Alſo a ſteel, with ſome brimeſtone to light a fire where ever they come: as alſo Tobacco and other odd things. The leathern purſe is alſo made of the ſame skin in an oval figure like a pear, in which they keep their mony, and other more choice things, and at this alſo they hang rings. Their needle caſe is of a peculiar ſort, they have a ſingle cloth with four ſides, but the upper part is much narrower then the lower, ſo that it is like an oblong triangle cut off at the vertical angle, and to make it ſtronger they bind about the edges with leather, and ſo ſtick their needles into it, this they put into a bag of the ſame ſhape, adorned with red, or ſome other colored cloth, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98689:52"/>wire, drawn together by a leathern ſtring, by which they hang it to their girdle. Beſides theſe, they have Alchymy chains, with a great company of rings of the ſame, theſe they hang about all their body, the bag they hang before, nigh their navel, all the reſt they fling behind them. And theſe are the Garments and ornaments of the body: their head they cover with a cap, over which the richer ſort wear a caſe of Fox, Beaver, or Badgers skin, they are very like our night-caps, it is made of red or other colored cloth, or of the Hares fur, firſt twiſted into a thred, and then knit almoſt like our ſtockins; or laſtly of the skin of the bird called <hi>Loom,</hi> with the feathers on it: ſometimes they ſo order it, that keeping alſo the head and wings of the bird, they make not an unbecoming cover for the head. <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> in his 4. Book, Cap. 3. ſaies they make their caps of the skins of Geeſe, Ducks, Cocks, which, as well as other birds, are there in great abundance. But he doth doth not here mean common Cocks, but the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galli,</hi> or Heath-Cocks; however he gives us the picture in his 17 Book, Cap. 26. They have ordinary gloves, but ſhoes of a peculiar make, they are made of the skin of the Rain-deer with the hair on, out of one piece, only where they tread they ſew both ends together, ſo that the haires of one part may lie forward, and the other backward, leaſt if they lay all one way they ſhould be too ſlippery: but neither is there any more leather on the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom then on other parts, as it is in our ſhoes, only there is a hole at the top in which they put in their feet: the toe bends upwards, and ends as it were in a point. Upon the ſeame they place ſome narrow pieces of red, or other colored cloth: theſe ſhoes they wear on their bare feet, and bind them twice or thrice about the bottom with a thong, and leaſt they ſhould be too looſe, they fill them up with a ſort of long Hay, which they boil and keep for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But now let us come to the garments they do not ſo ordinarily wear, but only on ſome occaſions, which both for the men and women are made alike, and all of leather, to ſecure them from the gnats. But in the Winter time the men have breeches to defend them from the weather, and coats which they call <hi>Mudd.</hi> Theſe <hi>Mudd</hi> are not all alike, but ſome better, ſome worſe; the beſt are of the skins of young wild Rain-deers, juſt when they have caſt their firſt coat, in the place of which comes a black one, which is about the Feaſt of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James,</hi> and theſe are very ſoft and delicate. Their feet they defend with boots of the ſame skins, and their hands with gloves or mittens of the ſame, and their heads with a cap, which reaches down and covers part of their ſhoulders alſo, leaving only a ſpace for them to ſee through. All theſe Garments they wear next their skin without any lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen underneath, and tie them round with a girdle, only their boots and gloves they ſtuff with hay, and ſometimes in the Winter with wool. And this is that which <hi>Johannes Tornaus</hi> ſaies of their cloathing, that their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is made of the Rain-deer, the skin of the beaſt ſupplying them with coats, breeches, gloves, ſandals, ſhoes, &amp;c. the hair being alwaies on the outſide, ſo that they ſeem to be all hairy. And hence we may underſtand <hi>Zieglerus,</hi> when he ſaies their Winter garments were made of the skins of Bears and Sea-Calves, which they tied in a knot at the top of their heads, leaving nothing to be ſeen but their eyes, ſo that they ſeemed to be in a ſack, only that it was made according to the ſhape of their members; and hence,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98689:52"/>ſaies he, I beleive they came to be ſuppoſed all hairy like beaſts, ſome reporting this out of ignorance, and ſome delighting to tell of ſtrange wonders they ſaw abroad. And truly it is not without reaſon that he gathers the fable of hairy men to be raiſed from their hairy Garments, which ſort of monſters whether there be in other Countries I cannot tell, but I find the <hi>Cyclops</hi>'s with one eye in their forehead by <hi>Adamus Bremenſis</hi> to be placed here upon the ſame account, becauſe they had only a hole in their cap through which they looked, all the reſt of their body ſeeming hairy, and therefore this hole they feigned to be an eye. But whereas he ſaies the skins were of Bears and Sea-Calves, he is a little miſtaken, for theſe skins were not ſo common among the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> and are by them deſigned quite for another uſe. However theſe Garments they uſed after their faſhion to adorn with pieces of red, or other colored cloth, and embroider them with wire, in flowers, ſtars, &amp;c. as I will hereafter declare more at large.</p>
               <p>But I come to the habit of the women, which alſo was of one ſort in the Summer, and of another in the Winter. In the Summer they wear coats which cover their breaſts, arms, and all their body, about the middle they are gathered, and ſo hang down, theſe they call <hi>Volpi.</hi> Theſe gowns they alſo wear next their skin, for the uſe of ſmocks is no more known among women then the uſe of ſhirts among men: and they horribly impoſed upon <hi>Lomenius Comes,</hi> that made him beleive otherwiſe. <hi>Lomenius</hi> ſaies thus, they have ſmocks, not made of linnen, but of the entrails of beaſts, which they firſt ſpin into a thread, and afterwards wear them: but all this is quite falſe. The entrals indeed they do ſpin into thred, but of that they make neither cloth nor ſmocks, but uſe it to few their skins; but women of the common ſort wear courſe cloth, and the better ſort finer, as it is with the men, which for the moſt part is Engliſh cloth, richly wrought. They have alſo a girdle, but different from that of the men, for it is much larger, and ſometimes three fingers broad, and then alſo it is adorned not with ſtuds, but plates of a fingers length, or more, which are engraved with divers ſhapes of Birds, Flowers, &amp;c. and theſe they faſten upon a leathern fillet ſo nigh one another, that the girdle is almoſt covered with them. Theſe plates are moſt commonly made of tin, from whence <hi>Sam. Rheen</hi> calls them tin girdles, but thoſe for the better ſort are made of ſilver. Upon theſe girdles they hang many Alchymy chains, upon one of which they hang a knife and ſheath, upon another a pouch or purſe, upon another a needle caſe, and upon all a great company of Alchymy rings, according to the faſhion of the men: Theſe things they do not hang by their ſides, as women among us uſe, but before them. The weight of the trinkets they carry about them, doth commonly weigh twenty pound, a pretty heavy burden, and ſuch as a man would wonder they ſhould be able to bear: but they are very much delighted with it, eſpecially with the number of the rings, the gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling of which is very gratefull to their ear, and as they think no ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to their beauty. <hi>Wexionius</hi> makes the chains and rings to be tin, which I beleive is hardly true, commonly I am ſure they were made of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymy, and if they had bin of tin they had neither bin durable, nor would they have made a noiſe. They have alſo another ornament for their breaſt, which they call <hi>Kracha,</hi> it is made of red, or ſome other colored cloth. And firſt it goes about their neck, and then on both ſides comes down upon
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98689:53"/>their breaſt, and a little below their breaſt ends in a narrow point. This cloth, eſpecially before, and ſometimes about the neck, they adorn with ſtuds, engraved with divers forms, as alſo with bracelets, which the richer have of ſilver and gold, the poorer of tin and Alchymy. After this manner, in ſhort as he uſes, <hi>Johannes Tornaeus</hi> deſcribes them, the women do ſo deck themſelves with gold and ſilver that their breaſts ſhine like ſheilds, but thoſe that cannot reach ſilver, uſe copper and Alchymy. Now theſe ſtuds they uſe to have not only about their neck, but upon their gowns where they draw them together, and lace them; and not only in ſingle but double and triple rows. They cover their heads with a low kind of kercheif, plain at top, round, and of red color, ſome of the richer ſort on extraordinary times add alſo a ſtrip of linnen for ornament, as at their Fairs, Weddings, and Feaſts. Upon their legs they wear ſtockins, which reach no lower then their ankles, but that only in the Summer. Their ſhoes are like the mens, and ſo alſo bound to their feet with thongs. The womens habit in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is almoſt the ſame with the mens, for they have the <hi>Muddas</hi> made of the skins of Rain-deers, and at that time wear breeches too, by reaſon of the deep Snows, ſtorms, and badneſs of the waies: nay and cover their head with the ſame caps men do, which ſort of caps they wear alſo ſometimes in the Summer to defend them from the gnats: theſe caps they tie about their heads, and the lower part, which would otherwiſe fall about their ſhoulders, they make to ſtand out like the brims of our hats. And theſe are the garments as well of Virgins as married women, for both uſe the ſame attire, neither is there any ſign in their habit whereby to diſtinguiſh them. Beſides theſe garments wherewith they clothe themſelves in the day, they have alſo other which they uſe a nights, ſuch as are called night-cloathes, for they have no feather beds: and without all doubt <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> is mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken who in his 4 Book ſaies they had. Their night garments were of 2 ſorts, ſuch as they lay upon, or ſuch as they did cover themſelves with, which alſo differ according to the Summer and Winter Seaſons. Thoſe they lie upon are Rain-deers skins, 2 or 3 of which they fling upon ſome birch leaves, which they uſe inſtead of matts, without beds, upon the ground, that they may lie ſofter, ſo that they lie upon the skins without ſheets, of the uſe of which they are quite ignorant. They cover themſelves in the Summer with blankets, which they call <hi>raaner</hi> or <hi>ryer,</hi> and with theſe blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets they cover not only their whole body, but alſo their heads too, to avoid the gnats, with which they are extremly infeſted in the night time. But that they may breath with more freedom, and not be inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nienced with the weight of theſe blankets, they ſometimes hang them up over their head with ropes faſtned to the top of their Hut. Theſe are their Summer coverlets: but in the Winter they firſt throw about them the skins of Sheep or Rain-deer, and on them the blankets now mentioned. And there is one thing more worth our notice, that they lie under theſe both Winter and Summer ſtark naked, and make no uſe of linnen. And ſo much for the Garments of the <hi>Laplanders.</hi> I ſhall add the Figures of both Sexes habited after their manner. The woman hath a child in her arms, in a Laplandiſh Cradle.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Of the Diet of the <hi>Laplanders.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HAVING diſcourſed of their Garments, I proceed to ſpeak of their Diet. Their food is not the ſame amongſt them all, but different according to the places they inhabit. The Mountaineers live almoſt wholly on their Rain-deers, that furniſh them with Milk, Cheeſe, and Fleſh: tho ſometimes they buy from the neighboring parts of <hi>Norway</hi> Sheep, Goats, and Oxen, which they milk in the Summer, and kill in the Winter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have neither Paſture nor Stable room for them to keep them long. And for this reaſon they buy but very few of them, and feed almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98689:54"/>on their Rain deer, which they have in great abundance. The fleſh of theſe they feed on in the Winter, and that alwaies boiled, but in the Summer their diet is Milk, Cheeſe, and dried fleſh. Their dainties moſt in eſteem with them are the tongue and marrow of their Rain-deers, and with theſe they are want to entertain their Prieſts. One odd kind of diſh theſe of the Mountains have, and that is the blood of their Rain-deers boiled in water to the conſiſtence of a haſty pudding. The others that dwell in the Woods feed partly on Fiſh, and partly on Birds and Beaſts, and that too both Summer and Winter, bnt more frequently on Fiſh. The fleſh of Beares they prefer before all other, and with that they feaſt their deareſt friends.</p>
               <p>They have alſo ſome kind of Sawces of Black-berries, Straw-berries, and other peculiar ones of their own; as alſo wild <hi>Angelica,</hi> and the inner rine of the Pine-tree. The uſe of Bread and Salt is almoſt unknown to them, and when they have any of the later, they uſe it very ſparingly. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of bread they eat dried fiſh, which by grinding they reduce to a kind of meal, and inſtead of Salt the inward rine of the Pine-tree, prepared after an odd kind of manner. They pull the bark off firſt, and then they take the inward rine, and divide it into thin skins like parchment, making it very clean; theſe they dry in the Sun, and then tearing it into ſmall pieces they put it up in boxes made of the barks of trees: theſe they bury under ground, and cover them with ſand. When they have bin dried about a day, they kindle a great fire over the hole where they put their boxes, and by that means the rines acquire a red color, and a very pleaſant taſt. On Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies they eat no fleſh, but feed either on fiſh, or milk, having retained this cuſtom from their Roman Catholic Prieſts. They boil all their freſh fleſh, but not very much; that their broth may be the better and fuller of gravy: and ſometimes they put alſo fiſh into the ſame kettle. Their milk they either boil with ſome quantity of water, it being of it ſelf to thick, or elſe they let it ſtand in the cold, to freeze into a kind of Cheeſe, that it may be kept longer for uſe. Their fiſh they eat ſometimes freſh as ſoon as they catch them; ſometimes they dry them in the Sun, and being hardned by the wind and air, they may be kept ſeverall years.</p>
               <p>Their ſweet meats, which ſerve them inſtead of Apples, Nuts, and the like, are preparations made of ſeverall ſorts of Berries. When their Straw-berrries begin to be ripe, they gather them, and boil them in their own juice, without the addition of water, with a ſlow fire, till they are very ſoft: then they ſprinkle them over with a little ſalt, and putting them into a veſſell made of birch-bark, they bury it in the ground; and in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn and Winter when they have occaſion for them, they take them out as freſh as if they had bin newly gathered: and theſe ſtand them in good ſtead when no other Berries are to be had. Sometimes whilſt they are freſh they put them to the fleſh of Fiſh, and make an odd kind of diſh, after this manner. Having boiled the Fiſh they firſt bone them, and then add Straw-berries to them, and beat them together in a wooden peſtle to a maſh, and ſo eat it with ſpoons. And this diſh they make alſo with all other kinds of Berries. Another Kickſhaw that pleaſeth them very much, they make of <hi>Angelica.</hi> They take the ſtaulks before it ſeed, and ſcraping of the outward skin, they put the reſt upon coals, and ſo eat it broiled. They have alſo
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98689:54"/>another way of preparing it, and that is to boil them in whay for a whole day till they look as red as blood. But this ſort of meat is very bitter of it ſelf, but by cuſtom becomes pleſant enough to them, eſpecially ſince they are perſwaded 'tis a great preſervative of health. They likewiſe boil ſorrell in milk; as alſo the rine of the Pine-tree, which, as was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, being prepared, ſerves them inſtead of ſalt.</p>
               <p>I come next to ſpeak of their drink, which is ordinarily nothing but water; <hi>Lomenius</hi> calls it <hi>diſſolved Ice:</hi> but certainly he is miſtaken, for having ſuch plenty of Rivers and Lakes, for all the Ice they can hardly want water. And to prevent its freezing, they have alwaies ſome hanging over the fire in a kettle; out of which every one with a ſpoon takes what he pleaſes, and ſo drinks it hot, eſpecially in the Winter time. Beſides common water, they often drink the broth I ſpoke of, made of fleſh and fiſh, which they call <hi>Laebma,</hi> and alſo whay, if you will beleive <hi>Olaus.</hi> Theſe are their uſual drinks; for Ale and Beer is utterly unknown to them. That which they drink for pleſure, is ſpirit of Wine and Brandy, with a little of which you may win their very ſouls. This they buy from <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> at their Fair times, and uſe it eſpecially at their ſolemn Feaſts and Weddings. I had almoſt forgot <hi>Tobacco,</hi> of which they are very great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers, and traffic for it as one of their cheif commodities.</p>
               <p>In the next place let us ſee the manner of their eating. Their dining room in the Winter time is that part of the Hut where the man and his wife and daughters uſe to be, and is on the right hand as you go in at the foregate: but in Summer without doors upon the green graſs. Sometimes too they are want to ſit about the kettle in the middle of the Hut. They uſe not much ceremony about their places, but every one takes it as he comes firſt. They ſeat themſelves upon a skin ſpread on the ground croſs-leg'd in a round ring; and the meat is ſet before them in the middle, upon a log or ſtump inſtead of a table; and ſeverall have not that, but lay their meat upon the skin which they fit on. Having taken the fleſh out of the kettle, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort put it upon a woollen table cloth called <hi>Waldmar,</hi> the richer on a linnen; as for trenchers and diſhes they are quite unknown to them. But if any liquid thing be to be ſerved up, they put it in a kind of trey made of birch. Sometimes without any other ceremony every one takes his ſhare out of the kettle, and puts it upon his gloves, or his cap. Their drink they take up in a wooden Ladle, which ſerves inſtead of plate. And it is farther obſervable that they are abominable gluttons when they can get meat enough; and yet hardy too to endure the moſt pinching hunger when they are forc't to it. When their meal is ended they firſt give God thanks, and then they mutually exhort one another to Faith and Charity, taking each other by the right hand, which is a ſymbol of their unity and brotherhood. <hi>Samuel Rheen</hi> tells us they lift up their hands firſt, and then ſay Grace after this manner, <hi>All thanks be given to God, who hath provided this meat for our ſuſtenance.</hi> This is their Grace in <hi>Pithilapmark.</hi> In <hi>Tornelapmark</hi> their Grace is a little different; they ſay in their own Tongue, <hi>Piaomaos Immel lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos kitomatz piergao odeſt adde misg moſea wicken ieggan taide ko mig laex iegnaſton,</hi> that is, <hi>Good God praiſed be thou for this meat: make that which we have at this time eaten give strength to our bodies.</hi> And ſo much for their Diet, and manner of eating.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Of the Hunting of the <hi>Laplanders.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HAVING ſpoke of thoſe things that relate to their Meat, Drink, Cloathing, and other neceſſities, the ſubject of our next diſcourſe will be their employments, which are either rare and more ſolemn, or daily and more uſual: theſe latter too are of two ſorts, either common to both Sexes, or peculiar to one. Of thoſe that are proper to men Hunting is the cheif, for in this Countrey that exerciſe is lawfull to none but men: <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> is of the contrary opinion, and ſaies Lib. 4. Cap. 12. that there is here ſuch a multitude of Beaſts, that the men alone, without the help of women, dare not go out to hunt; and therefore they are as active in this ſport, if not more than men. I beleive he had not this from any good tradition, or his own knowledg, but rather followed the authority of ſome ancient Writers, as <hi>Procopius</hi> Lib. 2. <hi>Gothic.</hi> or <hi>Tacitus de mor. Ger.</hi> for whatſoever they ſay concerning the <hi>Fenni</hi> and <hi>Scritfinni,</hi> is ſo far from being true of the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> that they do not permit women ſo much as to touch their hunting weapons or beaſts brought home, and debar them all paſſage at that door thro which they go to that ſport, as will be ſhewed hereafter. They obſerve in hunting many things with great ſuperſtition, as not to go out upon ominous daies, ſuch as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Marks</hi> (whom they call <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tepaive</hi>) S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Clements</hi> and S. <hi>Catharines,</hi> becauſe they believe on theſe daies ſome misfortune will happen to their weapons, and that they ſhall have no good ſucceſs all the year after. They think they cannot proſper, unleſs they have firſt conſulted their Gods by their Drum, which they uſe before their going out, and have therefore ſeverall beaſts pictured upon it. This is chiefly before the hunting a Bear. The third obſervation is that they will not go out at the uſual door, but at one in the backſide of the houſe called <hi>Poſſe,</hi> I ſuppoſe it is to avoid women, the meeting of whom is an ill omen to huntſmen, and therefore they are forbidden to come on that ſide of the houſe where this door is, as <hi>Ol. Matthias</hi> aſſured me while I was writing this, who was very well acquainted with this Country. <hi>Zieglerus</hi> ſaies the ſame, tho ſomething obſcurely, that a woman is not to go thro this door that day her husband is hunting: but it is not only that day, but at no time elſe. All theſe things are by way of preparation. The hunting it ſelf is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious according to the time of year, and ſeverall ſizes of beaſts. In the Summer they hunt on foot with Dogs, which are very good in theſe parts, not only for their ſcent, but that they dare ſet upon any thing, being ſtill tied up to make them more fierce. In the Winter they themſelves run down the game, ſliding over the ſnow in a kind of ſcates, which I ſhall deſcribe more fully in another place. Little beaſts they chaſe with bow and arrows, the greater with ſpears and guns; tho ſometimes they uſe other arts. That ſort of beaſt they call <hi>Hermelines,</hi> they take in traps as we do Mice, which are ſo contrived of wood that the touching of any part makes them fall;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98689:55"/>ſometimes in pits and holes covered with ſnow, to hide the deceit, as alſo with Dogs that will gripe them to death. Squirrels they ſhoot with blunt darts, that they may not do an injury to their skins, which they very much eſteem. After this manner alſo they take Ermines. Other beaſts, as Foxes, Beavers, they kill with Javelins ſpiked with iron: but if they meet with a beaſt that hath a pretious skin, they are ſo expert at their weapons, as to direct the blow where it will do it leaſt harm. Foxes are frequently tempted with baits upon the ſnow ſtrowed upon twigs over deep pits, or caught in gins laid in their uſuall haunts, or elſe poiſoned with a ſort of moſs, which is peculiar for this uſe, but is ſeldome made uſe of where there are abundance of field Mice, which are the Foxes generall food. They faſten ſnares to boughs of trees to catch Hares in, and ſome of the above mentioned beaſts: and if any one find any thing faſt in theſe, he is obliged to give notice to the owner. I come now to the larger beaſts, of which Wolves are moſt commonly caught in holes, but ſometimes ſhot with bullets: theſe are their game frequently becauſe they have the greateſt plenty of them, and ſuffer the moſt dammages by them: and for their greater deſtruction, Sithes are often hiden under the ſnow to cut off their legs. After this manner too Leopards and Gulo's are deſtroyed, which is now a daies almoſt left off, becauſe the Countrey is ſo well furniſhed with guns, with which they alſo kill Elkes when they can find them. But with greateſt care and diligence they hunt Rain-deers and Bears, the former with all kind of weapons. At their rutting time in Autumn, about S. <hi>Matthews</hi> day, they entice them to their tame does, behind which the Huntſman lies to ſhoot them. And in the Spring, when the Snow is deep, the men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſlide after them, and eaſily take them, or ſometimes drive them into traps with Dogs: or laſtly they ſet up hurdles on both ſides of a way, and chaſe them in between them, ſo that at laſt they muſt neceſſarily fall into holes made for that purpoſe at the end of the work. The hunting of the Bear follows, which, becauſe it is done with the moſt ceremonies and ſuperſtitions, will require the more care and accurateneſs in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, their buſineſs is to find out where the Bear makes his den againſt Winter. He that finds it is ſaid <hi>hafwa ringet bioern,</hi> i. e. to encompaſs the Bear. He uſually after this goes to all his friends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with much joy, to invite them to the hunting as to a ſolemn and magnificent feaſt, for, as is before ſaid, this beaſts fleſh is a great delicacy. But they never meet before <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April,</hi> till they can uſe their ſliding ſhooes: at which time he chooſes the beſt drummer among them, and by his beating conſults whether the hunting will be proſperous or no, which done they all march into the field in battel array after him that invited them as Captain, who muſt uſe no other weapon then a club, on whoſe handle is hung an Alchymy ring. Next him goes the drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, then he that is to give the firſt blow, and after all the reſt as their office requires, one to boil the fleſh, another to divide it, a third to gather ſticks and provide other neceſſaries: ſo they ſtrictly obſerve that one ſhould not incroach upon anothers office. When in this order they are come to the den, they ſet upon the Bear valiantly, and kill him with ſpears and guns, and preſently ſing in token of victory thus, <hi>Kittulis pourra,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98689:56"/>Kittulis ii skada tekamis ſoubbi iaella zaiiti,</hi> that is, <hi>they think the Bear for coming, and doing them no harm in not breaking their weapons,</hi> in the ſinging of which their Captain is the cheif Muſician. After celebration of their victory, they drag the Bear out, beating him with ſtaves, whence they have a Proverb, <hi>ſlao bioern med riis,</hi> that is, <hi>the Bear is beat,</hi> which ſignifies he is killed. Then putting him upon a ſledge, they draw him with Rain-deers to the Hut where he is to be boiled, ſinging <hi>Ii paha tolking gio, ii paha talka pharonis,</hi> that is, <hi>they beſeech the Bear that he would not raiſe tempests againſt them, or any way hurt them that killed him.</hi> This they ſay by way of jeſt, unleſs we will ſuppoſe them (as ſome of them really do) to imagine the killing of ſome kind of wild beaſt portends ill to the hunter. <hi>Samuel Rheen</hi> ſpeaks of a different ſong from this we have mentioned, much to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that they thank God for making beaſts for their ſervice, and giving them ſtrength and courage to encounter and overcome ſo ſtrong and cruel a creature, and therefore I beleive they may join them together and ſing both. That Rain-deer that brings home the Bear is not to be uſed by Women for a year, and ſome ſay, by any body elſe. If there be materialls, near the place where the Bear is kill'd, they uſually build up a hovel there to boil him in, or if not, carry him to a place that is more convenient, where all their Wives ſtay to expect them, and as ſoon as the men come nigh them they ſing <hi>Laeibi ia tuoli ſuſco,</hi> that is they ask their wives to chew the bark of the Alder Tree and ſpit it in their faces. They uſe this rather then any other Tree, becauſe when 'tis bruiſed between their teeth, it grows red, and will dy any thing, and the men being ſprinkled with this, as if it were the Bears blood, ſeem to have gone through ſome notable exploit not without danger and trouble. Then their wives aiming with one eye through an Alchymy Ring ſpit upon them: <hi>Samuel Rheens</hi> opinion differs only in this, that but one woman ſpits in the Captains face. This ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony is not done in the Hut where the Bear is kill'd, but at the back door: for they build two Tents, one for the men where the Bear is to be dreſt, and the other for the women in which they make the feaſt: where as ſoon as the men come in, the Women ſing <hi>Kittulis pouro tookoris,</hi> that is, they thank their husbands for the ſport they had in killing the Bear: ſo they ſit down men and women together to eat, but not of Bears fleſh. Supper end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the men preſently depart into the other houſe, and dreſſing the Bear provide another meal: and it is not lawful for any of thoſe Hunters to ly with his wife in three daies after, and the Captain in five. The Bears skin is his that firſt diſcovers him. They boil the fleſh blood and fat in braſs Kettles, and what ſwims they skim off and put in wooden veſſels; to which are faſten'd as many Alchymy plates as there are Bears killed. Whilſt the meat is boiling they all ſit down in order about the fire, the Captain firſt on the right hand, then the Drummer, and next he that ſtruck the firſt blow; on the left hand firſt the Wood-cleaver, then the Water-bearer, and after the reſt according to their place. This done the Captain divides it between the Women and Men. In the diviſion the Women muſt have none of the poſteriours, for they belong only to the men; neither is it lawful for a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to come and fetch their diviſion, but 'tis ſent them by two men, who ſay thus to them, <hi>Olmai Potti Sueregiſlandi, Polandi, Engelandi, Frankichis, i. e.</hi> that they came a great way off, from <hi>Swedland, Poland, England,</hi> or
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98689:56"/>
                  <hi>France;</hi> theſe men the women meet, and ſing <hi>Olmai Potti Sweregiſlandi, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landi, Engelandi, Frankichis, Kalka Kauhſis laigit touti tiadnat, i. e.</hi> you men that come from <hi>Swedland, Poland, England,</hi> or <hi>France;</hi> we will bind your legs with a red liſt, and ſo they do. But if we believe <hi>Samuel Rheen</hi> the Drummer divides the mens part to every one an equal portion. When all the meat is eaton, they gather up the bones, and bury them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; then the Captain hangs up the skin upon a pole, for the women blindfolded to ſhoot at, they ſinging all the while <hi>Batt Olmai Potti Swere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlandi, Polandi, Engelandi, Frankichis, i. e.</hi> we will ſhoot at him that came from <hi>Swedland,</hi> &amp;c. but ſhe that hits it firſt gets the moſt credit, and they believe her husband will have the beſt fortune in killing of the next Bear. She is alſo obliged to work in cloth with wire as many croſſes as there are Bears kill'd, and hang them upon every one of the hunters necks, which they muſt wear three whole daies. It is the opinon of the aforeſaid Author, that all the women do the ſame, and the men wear them four daies: he ſaies alſo that the <hi>Raindeer</hi> that brought home the Bear muſt have one croſs. I cannot as yet find any other reaſon of this ceremony, but that they ſuppoſe theſe croſſes to be preſervatives againſt all the dammages they can receive from the Gods of the Woods for killing their Bear: for to this day they are of the opinion that ſome Gods have taken charge of ſome beaſts, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Bear, becauſe he in this country is King over all the reſt. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the time of abſtinence is exſpired, the cloſe of all this ſolemnity, is the mens returning to their wives, which is thus; All after one another take hold of that rope, to which they hang their Kettle, and dance thrice round the fire, and ſo run out of the mens Tent into the womens, where they are met with this ſong, <hi>Todna Balka Kaino oggio,</hi> we will thro a ſhovel full of aſhes upon your legs. <hi>Samuel Rheen</hi> ſpeaking of this cuſtome, ſaies the men muſt not go to their wives till it be done, as if it were an expiation for their unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in killing a Bear. Thus you ſee with how many Laws and ſuperſtitions they Hunt this Beaſt, ſome of which are common in hunting of others, as the not admitting women to the ſport, and debarring them from touching the prey when it is taken, as alſo that the men return home through the back door. And here 'tis obſervable that they never carry in Beaſts, Birds, or Fiſhes, but throw them in before them, without doubt out of ſuperſtition that they may ſeem to drop from Heaven and be ſent by providence: tho moſt of them know not the original of ſuch ſuperſtitious ceremonies, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow the example of their forefathers. In fine nothing is accounted here a greater credit or honor to a man then the killing of a Bear, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have public marks for it, every one lacing his cap with as many wires as he has kill'd Bears.</p>
               <p>I come now to their fowling, which is proper alſo to men, and is alterable according to the time of year or largneſs of the fowl, for in the Summer they shoot altogether, but in the Winter catch in Snares and Springes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Lagopus</hi> call'd by the <hi>Swedes Sniaeriper.</hi> They make kind of hedges with abundance of holes in them, in which they ſet Springes, ſo that this Bird being moſt upon the ground, and running about, is eaſily caught in them: as for the taking of other Birds there is nothing worth a particular obſervation.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> Of the <hi>Laplanders</hi> Weapons, and other inſtruments of Hunting.</head>
               <p>BY the former Diſcourſe it plainly appears that in hunting they uſe ſeverall Inſtruments and Weapons, in our next therefore it will be requiſite to give ſome account of them. The firſt and moſt frequent is a bow three ells long, two fingers broad, and an inch thick, being made of Birch and Pine (which by reaſon of the reſine in it is very flexible) and covered over with Birch bark, to preſerve both from the weather. What <hi>Lomenius</hi> ſaies of its being made of Rain-deers bones, muſt needs be falſe, ſince no bone can be ſo pliable as is required in the making of a bow; his words are theſe, <hi>Rangiferi aſperantur oſſa in cultros &amp; curvantur in arcus congeneribus feris trucidandis,</hi> if he had left out <hi>&amp; curvantur in arcus</hi> he had ſpoke more to the purpoſe: but I believe he had this, beſides many other things, to fill up his Journall from <hi>Olaus Magnus,</hi> who among the utenſils theſe People have from the Rain-deers, ſaies the Fletchers much deſire their bones and horns, from whence <hi>Lomenius</hi> collects that bows are made of them. But it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that <hi>Olaus</hi> meant not this bow, but a kind of croſs-bow termed by the Germans <hi>Armbrust,</hi> and the French <hi>Arbalestre,</hi> which is impoſſible to be made of bone, but the handle might be adorned with it, becauſe in theſe Northern parts they have no mother of Pearle, which other Countries per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps make uſe of to this purpoſe. It was then a good plain wooden long-bow, which would not require an engine to bend it, but might be drawn with an hand only. And ſince I told you it was made of two pieces of wood, we will ſee next how they were joined together, which is with a kind of glew made of Perches skin well ſcaled, that melts in uſing like ours. They have alſo ſteel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bows, which are ſo ſtrong, that when they bend them they muſt put their foot in a ring for that purpoſe at the head of them, and draw the ſtring up to the nut, made of bone in the handle, with an iron hook they wear at their girdle. From their bows I paſs to their darts and arrows, which are of two ſorts, either pointed with iron to kill the larger beaſts, or blunt without it like bolts, to kill the ſmaller. Theſe points are not alwaies made of iron, but ſometimes bones, which are faſtned with glew into a hole bored with a hot iron at the end of a ſtaff, and afterwards ſharpened with a knife, or on a whetſtone. But beſides they uſe Guns, which they (as hunters do in other places) with a great deal of ſuperſtition enchaunt that they ſhould never miſs. Theſe are made at <hi>Soederhambn,</hi> a town in <hi>Helſingia,</hi> famous for weapons, from whence the <hi>Bothnians</hi> buy them, and ſell them to the <hi>Laplanders:</hi> hence they have Gun-powder and bullets, or at leaſt lead to make them: and ſometimes <hi>Norway</hi> furniſhes them with all theſe. Spears they uſe only in hunting Bears, and are ſo little different from ours that they will not need a deſcription. I come now to their other inſtruments relating
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98689:57"/>to this ſport, the cheifeſt of which are their ſhoes, with which they ſlide over the frozen ſnow, being made of broad planks extremely ſmooth; the Northern People call them <hi>Skider,</hi> and by contraction <hi>Skier</hi> (which agrees ſomething with the <hi>Germans Scheitter,</hi> that is, cleft wood) and ſometimes <hi>Andrer</hi> or <hi>Ondrur</hi> or <hi>Skiidh.</hi> Their ſhape is, according to <hi>Olaus Magnus,</hi> five or ſix ells long, turned up before, and a foot broad: which I cannot believe, becauſe I have a pair which are a little broader, and much ſhorter, and <hi>Wormius</hi> had a pair but of three ells long. And thoſe are much ſhorter which are to be ſeen at <hi>Leiden,</hi> which <hi>Friſius</hi> ſaies are juſt ſeven foot long, four inches and a little more broad: and it muſt needs be ſo to hold with <hi>Olaus Magnus,</hi> and every bodies opinion, that one ſhoe muſt be longer than the other by a foot, as if the man or woman be eight foot high, one muſt be eight foot, and the other nine. <hi>Friſius</hi> ſaies they are both of a length at <hi>Leiden,</hi> and <hi>Olaus Wormius</hi> takes no notice of any difference in his, but I believe then thoſe were of two Pariſhes, for my biggeſt is juſt ſuch an one as <hi>Friſius</hi> deſcribes covered over with reſin or pitch, and the ſhorter plain. But becauſe the larger is of greateſt uſe, it is no wonder that one or two of them were ſent abroad for a pattern, but ſince thoſe at <hi>Leiden</hi> are both the biggeſt, they were not made for men ſo tall as <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> ſpeaks of, they fitting men of ſix foot, which is a ſtature ſometimes met with in <hi>Lapland.</hi> They are ſmooth and turned up before, not behind, as they are pictured in <hi>Wormius,</hi> not by the fault of the Author, but the Painter, for the original in his ſtudy ſhews them otherwiſe; I have obſerved in my longer ſhoe that it is not quite ſtrait, but ſwells up a little in the middle where they place their foot. <hi>Friſius</hi> did ill in giving a picture but of one, and in that nothing of this bending, I will therefore deſcribe both, and a <hi>Laplander</hi> ſliding in them.</p>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98689:58"/>but by the ſides, that it might not hinder their ſliding, or wear out with often uſing, which is not expreſſed in <hi>Friſius's</hi> Picture, this is directly in the middle, and ti'd to the hinder part of the leg, as you may ſee in the figure. That which is often in <hi>Olaus Magnus,</hi> and ſet forth by <hi>Friſius,</hi> is a meer fancy and figment of an Italian Painter, that could not underſtand what theſe ſhoes were, but by deſcribing them like long wooden broags turning up with a ſharp point before: which is very idle, becauſe the foot goes into it at the hinder part, and agrees not with <hi>Olaus's</hi> other cuts; for if the place of the foot were there, it could not endure ſo great a weight before it, or effect that for which this ſhoe was firſt invented: for they muſt tread firm upon the Snow, which they could not do if all the weight lay at one end; but when 'tis in the middle, that which is before and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind will keep the foot from ſinking in. The way of going in them is this: they have in their hand a long ſtaff, at the end of which is a large round piece of wood faſten'd, to keep it from going deep into the Snow, and with this they thruſt themſelves along very ſwiftly. This way of running they not only uſe in plain and even, but in the muſt rugged grounds, and there is no Hill or Rock ſo ſteep, but with winding and turning they can at laſt come up to the top, (which Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Third could not believe) and that which is a greater Miracle will ſlide down the ſteepeſt places without danger. Theſe ſhoes they cover with young <hi>Rain-deers</hi> skins, whoſe haires in their climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing run like briſles againſt the Snow, and keep them from going back. <hi>Wormius</hi> ſaies they were cover'd with Sea Calf's skins, but I believe he talk'd of thoſe, that the <hi>Siaefinni,</hi> or the Maritime people uſe. And this is the firſt inſtrument of hunting, which they uſe as well in other buſineſſes in winter time, for they can paſs no other way over the Snow, at which time they can out run any wild beaſt. The other inſtrument they uſe is a ſledg, which altho it is fit for any journy, they uſe it in hunting eſpecially the <hi>Rain-deeres,</hi> the deſcription of which, becauſe 'tis fit for all manner of carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, I ſhall defer to another place.</p>

               <p>BEsIDEs hunting, which is the cheifeſt, they have many other emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments relating to their lives and fortunes, of which Cookery is the firſt: for what ever food they get by fiſhing, fowling, or hunting, the men dreſs and not the women. They therefore are quite ignorant of this Art, (which the men are not very expert at) and never uſe it but upon neceſſity, and in the abſence of men.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is the boat-makers, which they make of Pine or Deale boards, not faſten'd with nails but ſew'd together with twigs, as among the ancients with thongs, <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> and <hi>Johannes Tornaeus</hi> ſayes with roots of trees, but moſt commonly with <hi>Rain-deers</hi> nerves. When they launch theſe boats
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98689:58"/>they caulk them with moſs to keep out the water, and uſe ſometimes two, ſometimes four oares, ſo faſten'd to pegs in the ſides, that one man may row with two.</p>
               <p>The third trade is the Carpenters, to make ſledges, which are not all of the ſame ſhape, thoſe they travel in, call'd <hi>Pulca</hi> being made in the faſhion of half a boat, having the prou about a ſpan broad turned up, with a hole in it to run a cord thro to faſten it to a <hi>Rain-deer,</hi> and the poupe of one ſlat board: the body is built of many, which are faſten'd with wooden pegs to four or five ribs; they never go upon wheeles, but are convex and round, that they may roul any way, and more eaſily be drawn over the Snow. This deſcription agrees with that ſledg which I have, and the Teſtimony of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berstenius, Olaus Magnus,</hi> and <hi>Johannes Tornaeus.</hi> The fore part of them is cover'd with Sea-Calfs skin for about an ell, ſtretch'd upon hoops, leaſt the Snow ſhould come in, under which they put moſs to keep their feet warm. Theſe are about three ells long, but thoſe that carry baggage, called <hi>ackkio, aj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>five,</hi> are not cover'd any where. The people defend their goods from the weather, according to <hi>Wexionius,</hi> with raw flax: but that is not probable, becauſe no flax grows there, and the uſe of flaxen garments is unknown, and therefore I believe they do it with skins or bark. In <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> lib. 17. cap. 25. there is a cart painted upon wheeles, the Author deſcribes it in theſe words, <hi>qui domestici ſunt Rangiferi curulibus plauſtris aptantur,</hi> but what theſe <hi>curulia plauſtra</hi> ſignifie he does not explain. And ſince the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has drawn other things according to his own capacity, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I do not know whether he has not follow'd his own opinion more then <hi>Olaus's</hi> narration, but 'tis certain there are no wheele carts, for what they carry in Summer is put in dorſers upon <hi>Rain-deers.</hi> Theſe Tradesmen make their ſliding ſhoes, which becauſe I have deſcrib'd in the former Chapter, I need not now ſpeak of.</p>
               <p>The fourth is making boxes and cheſts to lay up weapons and other things in, which are all of an oval ſhape, of which ſort <hi>Lodovicus Otto Bathonienſis</hi> gave me one. They are made of thin birch plancks, which are ſo contrived and bent into an Oval, that the pegs or twigs, with which they are faſten'd, are not perceiv'd. The lids are of one board, and for ornament often inlaid with <hi>Rain-deers</hi> bones in diverſe figures, which for better illuſtration you ſhall ſee deſcrib'd at the end of this Chapter in the cut markt with the letter C.</p>
               <p>The ſift Trade is making Baskets, in which Art no Nation can compare with them. The matter they make them off is roots of Trees, which they work not as other people do, for they make them of what bigneſs they pleaſe, and if occaſion require, will be ſo accurate in their work as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terweave the roots ſo neat and cloſe together, that they ſhall hold water like a ſolid veſſel. Their ſhapes are diverſe, ſome round with a cover and handle to carry them by, and others ſquares or oblongs. Not only the <hi>Laplanders</hi> and <hi>Swedes</hi> uſe theſe, but they are alſo for their curioſity and ſtrength ſent into farther Countries: the figure B. at the end will give a view of a round one.</p>
               <p>Beſide theſe the men make all manner of houſhold-ſtuff of wood or bone; and particularly ſpoons, one of which I have with all its Rings and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as you may ſee at figure A. I have two weaving inſtruments, a ſhuttle
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98689:59"/>about two inches long or more, with an hole at one end D. and a kind of comb or ſmall Loom in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they weave particular wreaths and ornaments E.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>They make alſo very neat Tobacco boxes carved with knifes in bone, with many Rings and other pretty appendages about them, all which being
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98689:59"/>conſidered will prove this Nation not to be ſo dull and ſtupid as by ſome it is ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p>They have alſo one Art more worth taken notice of, as ingraving flowers and ſeveral Beaſts in bone, into which they caſt ſeveral plates of Tin, and with theſe figures the men and women adorn their girdles and other things: the ſame way they make their molds for caſting bullets. They make inſtruments for all emploiments, as Cookery, &amp;c. thoſe for hunting are uſually made of bone, and others are commonly adorned with it. <hi>Zeigler</hi> mentions tubs, which are rather cups, or veſſels cut out of a ſtump of a Tree, as traies are: and <hi>Wexionius</hi> mentions other veſſels made of bark, but I forbear to ſpeak of any more, only I ſhall add that they learn their art not from maſters but their fathers according to their capacity.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> Of the Womens Emploiments.</head>
               <p>HAvING run thro the mens emploiments, the womens are next to be conſidered. Two trades are moſt peculiar to them, as doing the work of Taylors and Shoomakers, for they make and mend all the Clothes, Shoes, Boots and Gloves; and they have a third the making all thoſe things that join the Rain-deer to the ſledg, as collars, traces, &amp;c. in order to which they learn ſubſervient arts, as making thred, which is commonly of Rain-deers nerves, becauſe they have no flax: of this ſort I have ſome by me. <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> ſaith <hi>ad indumentorum uſum,</hi> for the making of ſhirts, which made <hi>Lomenius</hi> believe the women wove this thred into cloth, who I perceive in his ſhort deſcription of <hi>Lapland,</hi> hath very cloſely followed his words more then his ſenſe. In the making of their thred, which is of about 3 ells long, the extent of the Rain-deers nerves, they firſt cleanſe the nerves, then having cut off all the hard parts, they dry, and hatchell them, and laſtly mollify them with fiſhes fat. Beſides this they ſpin wool for ſwadling clothes, and Hares fur, with which they knit caps, as in other parts of <hi>Europe</hi> they do ſtockins with four knitting needles, which art the <hi>Germans</hi> call <hi>ſtricken.</hi> Theſe Caps are as ſoft as Swans down, and extremly warm. In the ſame manner they make Gloves, which are very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſiciall to them in the cold. The work of their ſillets is very curious, for they put in them many figures, as you may ſee at the end of the foregoing Chapter, at the figure I. The fourth trade is their covering thred with tin, which firſt they draw into wire by pulling it thro little holes in horn with their teeth, which holes they fill half up with bone, that the tin may be flat on one ſide, and fitter to be put on thred. The picture of a woman drawing wire you have in the next page. Then they put it upon the nerves by the help of a ſpindle, which doth ſo twiſt them together that they ſeem all tin, and when they have done, they wind it about their head or foot, leaſt it ſhould entangle and be ſpoiled. And this is their way of making thred of tin, as in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98689:60"/>other Countries of gold and ſilver, the chiefeſt uſe of which is in adorning their clothes after the way of Embroidery, which is the womens fifth art.

Thus they adorn all their veſtments, as gowns called <hi>Muddar,</hi> boots, gloves and ſhoes, and ſhe that doth it neateſt, is preferred before other women, and had in greater eſtimation. They do not immediately put this upon the fur of skins, but lifts of blew, green, or red woollen cloth.

                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:98689:60"/>Their gowns are embroidered about the neck, ſleeves, breaſt, and ſides; gloves about the tops, ſhoes; inſtep and toes; boots, about the knees; in which work they commonly picture; Stars, Flowers, Birds, Beaſts, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Rain-deers: and to make their clothes more glorious, they ſet them with ſpangles, fillets, points, and knots of this thred, and wear upon their head ſhreds of diverſe colored cloth, the pictures of all which you have in the former Chapter, Boots F, Gloves G, Shoes H. The Rain-deers harneſs they embroider in the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>Laſtly they have nothing that appears in ſight, but it is hereby made very commendable and ingenious. I have by me men and womens ſcrips, pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes, ſheaths for knives, very curiouſly wrought. Of all which, that I might not ſeem to give too a large commendation of them, I have put the Pictures in the foregoing page.</p>

               <p>THE other buiſineſſes, which we have not treated of yet, whether they be at home or in journies, belong to both Sexes, and that they may be the better undertaken, men and women wear breeches, and as <hi>Joh. Tornaeus</hi> takes notice, equally undergo all pains and work excepting hunting: by which words <hi>exceptâ venatione</hi> he doth not deny but men and women have peculiar emploiments. In their travels the maſter of a family goes firſt, with his baggage and Rain-deers after him, and next him his wife with hers, in Summer they both walk on foot, in Winter both are drawn in ſledges, which I have deſcribed in the next page: in theſe they like children are tied and bound faſt with fillets and cords, eſpecially when in haſt, having only their hands and head at liberty, and their back leaning againſt the end. The Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deer is not harneſſed like an Horſe, but hath a ſtrong cloth about his neck, to which is faſtened a rope that goes between his fore and hind feet, to the hole in the prou of the fledge. He therefore that drew <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> pictures was much deceived, when he made Rain-deers joined to the ſledge with traces on both ſides, and ſuch a collar about their necks, as is uſed in other Countries upon their thillers; and in another place two yoaked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether drawing a cart with wheels, which is a thing unknown to the <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> and men riding upon them as on a Horſe, whereas they never do ſo, but walk on foot, and carry their goods only on them in dorſers. He that is drawn rules the beaſt, not with a bridle, but an halter made of Sea-dogs skin tied about his head or horns, faſtned to a ſtick which he holds in one hand, with which he removes the thong to either ſide, according as he would go or turn: with the other he guides the ſledge, for it being round at bottom is ſtill wavering, ſo that he which rides, muſt ſtill with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his body, and hand, take care it overturns not, as you may ſee in the picture. When they thus travel in the Winter, the <hi>Rain-deers</hi> are bravely adorned with needle work of tin-thred upon diverſe colour'd cloth, about
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98689:61"/>their necks and back, and a bell, with which they are mightily pleaſed. They travell in theſe at what rate they will; but if upon a remove, alwaies ſlow, becauſe of the weight of their goods, in which journies the man and his
<figure>
                     <figDesc>depiction of a reindeer pulling a man in a sledge</figDesc>
                  </figure> wife go firſt, and all the family come after. <hi>Ziegler</hi> ſaies in 24 houres they can go 150 miles: <hi>Herbersternius</hi> ſaies in a day 20 <hi>German</hi> miles: but 'tis not to be believed that it is performed with one <hi>Rain-deer</hi> in the day of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98689:61"/>12 hours, except the waies be good and ſlippery, but they ordinarily go 12 14 or 16 <hi>German</hi> miles in ten hours, which number doubled will make out <hi>Zeigler</hi>'s opinion: and that not with one <hi>Rain-deer</hi> which is impoſſible to out ſo long, but that it muſt dy or be left to reſt the next day. In this way of travelling the Women are as expert as the men, and <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> ſaies more. As the men and women travel together, ſo they help one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in fiſhing, and at baiting time to feed their cattle, which is evident in the <hi>Rain-deer,</hi> for the women take as much care of them as the men, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take the trouble to milk them: and in fiſhing 'tis manifeſt; for women in the abſence of men, are very intent for ſome weeks at catching fiſh, which they gut and dry up for Winter. Their way of catching them is with Nets, and other inſtruments, as every where elſe. I know not what <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> meant, when he ſaid they have a fooliſh way of fiſhing, except he refers to their hooks which are not of Iron but Wood: they make them of <hi>Juniper</hi> bent round: theſe they faſten to ſticks, and throw them into the Rivers, and very eaſily take many large fiſhes. If they fiſh with a Cane or Whale-bone, the fiſher never knows when the fiſh bites, but pulls up at a venture. Their way of fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alters with the ſeaſon, in the Summer uſually with drag nets, between two boats, or elſe with ſpears like Tridents, but that they have more teeth. With theſe they ſtrike pikes, eſpecially when they ly ſunning themſelves near the top of the Water: they do the ſame by Night burning dry wood at the prow, by which light the Fiſh are enticed thither. In the Winter time they thruſt nets under the ice to a banck ſide, and then by a great noiſe above drive the Fiſh to them; all theſe things the Women often do alone, which is the leſs to be wondered at, becauſe every wherein this Country there is a great multitude of Fiſh. Beſides all theſe, they carry and cleave wood, and make hedges, with ſuch like works, which are ſo inconſiderable as not to be worthy to enlarge our diſcourſe.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> Of their Divertiſements.</head>
               <p>HAVING ſpoken of their ordinary emploiments, it will not be amiſs here to annex ſomething of their Divertiſements: where firſt we may note, that the people of this Country are generally diſpos'd to idleneſs, not willing to take any great paines, unleſs when meer neceſſity conſtrains them to provide againſt want. This they ſeem to derive principally from their Anceſtors the Finlanders, as is elſewhere ſaid. To which as well their cold conſtitution by reaſon of the ſharpneſs of the Air in this Country (that it ſelf is ſufficient to diſpoſe men to lazineſs,) as the length of their Nights, and indulgence to much ſleep. may contribute not a little. In fine, that I may omit their many other infirmities, whereby they are incapacitated to undergo any conſiderable hardſhip, they are lovers of ſloth and wholly given up to it. But further, to conſider how they beſtow their vacant time
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98689:62"/>from buſineſs, 'tis the general and moſt recieved accompt, that making and receiving viſits, and familiar converſation become the greateſt part of their recreations. For whereas their manner of life ſo nearly reſembles ſolitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that each family ſeems confined to its own hut, they can take no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſatisfaction in any thing then ſuch mutual entercourſe. And here it may be obſerved, that in their diſcourſes at theſe meetings of friends and acquaintance, uſually the moſt ordinary affairs and daily occurrences have the chiefeſt place: as particularly their welfare, emploiments, and the like. But beſides 'tis their humor to make remarks upon the transactions of all forreiners, whoſe names or cuſtomes commerce has at any time brought to their knowledg. And furthermore they can take no greater pride, then either in traducing the management of their affairs, or impoſing drolliſh Nick-names upon them. Tho indeed thoſe of the richer ſort are uſed to entertain their viſitants with greater merriment and magnificence. Beſides theſe viſits they uſe ſome ſports wherewith they recreate themſelves, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Winter (when for ſome ſpace of time they live as ſcateringly as in Summer, but are more familiar,) or at their public aſſemblies in the places of Judicature and Fairs. Again ſome ſports are looked upon as only pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to men, others the female Sex alſo have their part in. Of the firſt ſort this is one. They make a line in the Snow, in place of a goal: behind it at ſome paces diſtance they ſet up a mark, from whence each perſon taking a run to the goal, and there taking his riſe, throws his body as far as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he can, and he that at one leap compaſſes the greateſt ſpace of ground, is reckon'd the Conqueror. In this firſt ſport they both leap and run. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have where the trial of skill conſiſts in leaping only, and that too not in length but height; there ſtand two men upright, at no great diſtance the one from the other, and hold in their hands ſometimes a rope, ſometimes a pole, now higher, now lower, as is agreed upon by the combatants, uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at the common height of a man: then each Perſon attemts to leap over from a ſtation aſſign'd, and he that performs moſt dextrouſly, gains the applauſe to himſelf. A third ſort of ſport among them is with bow and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. At a convenient place they ſet up a mark of a very ſmall bigneſs, and ſhoot at it with arrows from any diſtance preſcrib'd. He that hits either ſooneſt or oftneſt, bears away the bell from the reſt. Theſe ſports hitherto mentioned are almoſt inſtituted by them meerly for the conſideration of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and renown: yet ſometimes they play for prizes ſuch as they agree up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among themſelves, and inſtantly they lay them down in the place where they keep their games. Their prizes are ſeldom mony, uſually skins, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of Squirrels, ſometimes one, ſometimes more as they ſee convenient and agree upon it. But in thoſe ſports wherein as well the women as men are plaiers, they commonly play with a leather ball ſtuffed with hay, about the bigneſs of ones fiſt; whatever company of men and women is there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, is ſorted into two ſides, one whereof ſeizes on this ground, the other on another oppoſite to it, and at ſome diſtance off. Then every Perſon of one ſide in his turn, beats the ball with a club thorough the Air, thoſe of the contrary ſide catching it at the fall; and if any one chance to catch it in his hands, before it touch ground, then the order of the play is inverted, and this ſide ſtrikes out the ball, the other is fain to catch. Thus play the

They beſides have another play at ball: in the hard frozen ſnow they draw two lines at ſome diſtance from one another, then all the multitude both of men and women parting into two ſides, one applies it ſelf to the defence of this, the other of that line; then they meet in the middle ſpace between their two goals, and fling down the ball, then each partie with bandies and clubs ſtrives to ſtrike the ball croſs the oppoſite parties line, each party ſtill maintaining the defence of its own line; but if one ſide chance to ſtrike the ball with their bandies over the others line (for it is foul play to fling it with their hands) and ſo take their goal, that is accounted the conquering ſide. The ſports as yet men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned are ſuch as belong to the younger ſort, as well as to thoſe of more mature age: the next is peculiar to theſe laſt and only to men. Their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom is to ſeparate themſelves into two companies, and attacque one another by wreſtling: firſt each company ſtands like a file of Soldiers all along in order to confront the adverſe company: then each man catches his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary by the girdle, wherewith all <hi>Laplanders</hi> are alwaies girt, as is elswhere ſhown, (their girdle goes ſix times round their body, and ſo is faſt and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for their purpoſe,) ſo each man having caught hold, endeavors to fling the other down, which they are not allowed to attempt by craft or deceit, as by any lock or the like; Any one that is found delinquent in this kind, is branded for a fowl plaier, and excluded the liſts. Theſe are the ſports that are almoſt peculiar to the <hi>Laplanders:</hi> beſides them they uſe ſome, which they borrow from other places, ſuch is playing at Cards, a ſport ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known thorough all <hi>Europe,</hi> for even the <hi>Laplanders</hi> take no little ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in it: they procure their Cards of the Merchants that trade thither. They uſe likewiſe to play at dice, which they themſelves make of wood after the common faſhion, with this only difference, that whereas dice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly have ſome number of ſpots inſcribed on every ſide, they have a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure made only on one ſide like an X. he wins in this ſport, that caſting two Dies, on the top of either can ſhow the X. their ſtakes are uſually Squirrils skins, or ſome ſmall trifles, and in the failance of theſe leaden bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, which they uſe in their hunting to charge their Guns withal: and it happens ſometimes that a fellow having loſt all his bullets, in hope of repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his damage by winning again, not only at preſent will be ſenſible of the harm, but being diſappointed of his Hunting puts to ſtake and looſes his future acquiſitions and hope of livelihood. Theſe are the uſual waies, whereby the people of <hi>Lapland</hi> ſpend their leiſure times and divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXV.</hi> Of their Contracts and Marriages.</head>
               <p>WE have hitherto taken a ſurvey of their ordinary imploiments, and ſuch as are almoſt every day in uſe, as well thoſe peculiar to each Sex, as common to both; likewiſe of their Divertiſements and ſports, wherewith they uſe to intermingle thoſe emploiments: It remains that we treat of thoſe buſineſſes, which do not every day occur, but are ſingular and ſolemn, and undertaken upon ſpecial occaſions. And firſt of what apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to their Marriages; Concerning them 'tis moſt memorable, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any perſon purpoſes to marry, 'tis his firſt buſineſs, to make ſearch after a Maid well ſtock'd with <hi>Raindeers.</hi> For the <hi>Laplanders</hi> have a cuſtom, (as ſhall hereafter more particularly be mentioned) of beſtowing upon their Children ſoon after their birth, ſome certain number of thoſe <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deers,</hi> and their increaſe is accounted of, not as the Parents eſtate, but the Childs portion. She therefore, that is beſt provided of them, is in moſt likely-hood of meeting with an Husband. Nor have they regard to any thing elſe, as either good breeding, or beauty, or other the common allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of woers. For they who dwell on a hard and barren ſoile are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſolicitous concerning food, which becauſe their <hi>Rain-deer</hi> afford, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one thinks himſelf beſt ſecured againſt want when he is beſt provided of them. As ſoon therefore as the young man has caſt about him for a wife, which is uſually done at their public meetings for paying of taxes, or upon the account of fairs; next he makes a journy to her parents, taking along with him his father, if alive, and one or two more whom he thinks will be moſt kindly welcome, but eſpecially one who may declare his affections, and win the favor of the Maids parents. When they arrive at the hut, they are all kindly invited in, only the ſuiter is fain to wait at door, and beſtow his time in chopping wood, or ſome ſuch trivial buſineſs, till he be ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd in alſo, for without expreſs permiſſion 'tis uncivil in him to enter. When they have drank of the Spirit of Wine, which the ſpokes-man brings, he applies himſelf to the management of his province, diſcloſes the Suiters affections to the Daughter, and makes his addreſs to her Father, that he will pleaſe to beſtow her in Marriage upon him. Which that he may atcheive with more ſucceſs, he honors the Father with the greateſt titles and names of renown that he can deviſe, at every one bowing the knee, as if he were treating with a prince. He ſtiles him with the High and Mighty Father, the Worſhipful Father, as if he were one of the Patriarcks, the beſt and moſt illuſtrious Father, and no doubt if they were acquainted with the Roial title of His Majeſtie, He would not ſcruple to call him, the moſt Majeſtic Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Wine, that the Suiter is ſuppoſed to have brought along with him therewith to pay his reſpects to her parents, whom he pretends to, they call either <hi>Pouriſtwyn</hi> (that is) the Wine of proſperous acceſs, or that Wine wherewith he deſigns to careſs his Father and Mother in Law,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98689:63"/>that are to be; or elſe, <hi>Soubowiin</hi> (that is the Wine of wooers which tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> daughter, and gain the favour and liking of the future Bride. But we must take notice, that the buſineſs is not propoſed to the maid her ſelf firſt but her parents; nor may the Suiter have any conference with her without their permiſſion. Nay 'tis the uſual cuſtom, at this time to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch her away upon ſome ſleevleſs arrand, either to the <hi>Rain-deers</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures in the Woods, or a Neighbors hut, ſo as neither the Suiter nor any of his company may have a ſight of her; but if at laſt either ſhe or ſome other woman procure leave for Her of her Parents or kindred, to ſpeak to him, their entertainment finiſhed he gets him out of the hut to his ſledg, and then takes out his woollen Cloth-Garments, (ſuch as they uſe to ſpruce themſelves up withal, at their public Feſtivals, or more ſolemn affairs) and what elſe is requiſite to the preſent buſineſs: when he has trimm'd himſelf up, he makes his addreſs to his Miſtreſs and ſalutes her. Their manner of Salutation is by a kiſs; in which that they mainly aim at is, that each not only apply his mouth to the others, but alſo that both their noſes touch; for otherwiſe it goes not for a true ſalute. Next he makes her a preſent of the rareſt delicacies that <hi>Lapland</hi> affords, the <hi>Rain-deers</hi> tongue, the Beavers fleſh, and other dainties, which ſhe refuſes to accept of in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of any body; preſently after ſhe is call'd aſide to ſome convenient place without the hut, then if ſhe profeſs her ſelf willing to receive them, the Suiter farther puts it to her, whether ſhe will grant him leave, that he may take his repoſe by her in the hut; if ſhe grant it, 'tis concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them of their future marriage: withal he preſents his gifts above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. If ſhe rejects his ſuit, ſhe caſts them all down at his feet. The Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom uſually carries them in his boſom, before he preſents them. The full approbation of the Parents, and the celebration of the wedding is uſed oftentimes to be deferr'd for a conſiderable while, ſometimes for two or three years together; and all that while they beſtow upon courting their Miſtreſſes. The reaſon why their time of Courtſhip or wooing proves ſo long, is becauſe the Bridegroom is neceſſitated to gratifie with frequent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, the parents and friends neareſt in blood to the Bride, without the leave of each of which he cannot compaſs the poſſeſſion of her. This is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Samuel Rheen</hi> in theſe words, When any Perſon pretends marriage to the Daughter of one of the richer ſort, he is obliged to make a preſent to her parents and neareſt Kinſmen, ſuch as is made for ſtate to Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors or cheif Officers, as large as his means will reach to, which preſent they call <hi>Peck,</hi> that is, Peices; every peice at leaſt muſt contain two marks of ſilver, that is, ſix ounces, there are ſome too, that muſt contain twenty, forty, ſometimes threeſcore ounces a peice, ſuch peices the Bridegroom is bound to beſtow upon His Miſtreſſes parents and her near kindred. In what things theſe preſents particularly conſiſt, I ſhall mention hereafter, for they do not give barely ſilver, but moulded into ſome faſhion, or other things beſides; while therefore the Bridegroom is emploied in procuring theſe pieces, 'tis no inconſiderable while that paſſes.</p>
               <p>In this interval he ever and anon makes a viſit to his Miſtreſs, to whom while he is travelling he ſolaces himſelf with a Love Song, and diverts the weariſomneſs of his journy. And 'tis their common cuſtom, to uſe ſuch
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98689:64"/>kind of Songs, not with any ſet tune, but ſuch as every one thinks beſt himſelf, nor in the ſame manner, but ſometimes one way, ſometimes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as goes beſt to every man, when he is in the mode of ſinging. An enſampel of one they uſe in the Winter ſeaſon, communicated to me by <hi>Olaus Matthias,</hi> a <hi>Laplander,</hi> I here annex.</p>

               <p>As they come to viſit their Miſtreſſes, they are neceſſitated to bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them ſome ſpirit of Wine, as a ſingular and moſt acceptable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and Tobacco too. But if in the mean while, as it often falls out, the father intends not to beſtow his daughter upon the man that hath made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to her, he ſeldom refuſes them, but defers the poſitive anſwer till the year following, that he may the oftner entertain himſelf with the ſpirit of Wine the Suiter brings along with him. And thus he delaies his anſwer from one year to the other, till the Suiter perceive himſelf cheated, and be conſtrained to require at his hands his charges made to no purpoſe. There is then no other remedy to be taken, then bringing the buſineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judg, where the Maids Father is ſentenced to refund either the entire ſum, or half of it, as the caſe ſtands. Where withal we muſt obſerve this, that the expences made by the Suiter on the Spirit of Wine, at his firſt arrival, do not fall under this compenſation, but he alone ſtands to the loſs of that. But if after the downright refuſal of the Maid, he of his own accord will ſhow his liberality, he may try what luck he will have at his own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril.

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XXVI.</hi> Of their Child-bearing, and the Education of their Children.</head>
               <p>NEXT to Marriage it will be expedient to treat of their Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing, and their Children. Where we may note firſt, that they wiſh for nothing more, and that they take no greater pleſure in any thing then fruitfull Matrimony. And hence it is, I ſuppoſe, they are ſo prone to luſt, as is elſewhere ſhown: but altho they deſire this ſo ardently, yet they are very ſeldome fruitfull in Children, for they can ſcarce beget more then eight, which number is the greateſt, and uſually they beget but one, two, or three. An occaſion of this their barreneſs, <hi>Sam. Rheen</hi> imagines their bad diet, as likewiſe the extreme coldneſs of the Country, which I think may be very true. He moreover adds Gods anger, which he collects from this, becauſe tho they are not worn away with War or Plague, yet notwithſtanding their Country is never the more populous, and their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion waſts rather daily. The motive of this anger he ſuppoſes to be their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinateneſs in maintaining their ancient impieties. They uſe indeed at this very day, not only in Child-bearing, but other affairs too, to be ſolicitous concerning the events, and to ſearch after them by their ſuperſtitious rites. Their firſt care is concerning the ſex, for as ſoon as they perceive the wife to be big with child, they have an opinion that they can inform themſelves whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will prove a Boy or a Girl, after this manner: they forthwith view the Moon (for they imagine that a Child-bearing woman bears ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to the Moon, as we ſhall hear) if there be a Star juſt above the Moon, they thence collect that the burden will prove of the male ſex, if below, of the female. But I wonder they make a compariſon between the Moon and a woman with child. For can there be any account given of their reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance? is it, that like the Moon, ſhe grows big with her burden, and when that is laid, leſſens again? I rather ſuppoſe that theſe are the reliques of their Pagan ſuperſtition, which made the Moon the tutelar Goddeſs to women with child. For ſo moſt of the Pagans did account other, which opinion being outdated, they yet pretend ſome reſemblance between them. Their ſecond care is touching the health or ſickneſs of the child, which thing alſo they ſuppoſe the Moon will inform them in. For if a Star be juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Moon, they take it for a ſign that the child will prove healthfull, and grow up to be a man. But if it comes juſt after her, they thence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage that the child will be a very ſickly one, and not long lived.</p>
               <p>The woman with child laies her burden in a hut, but (which any body may underſtand) a ſufficient incommodious one, eſpecially if the time of her delivery happen to be in the Winter, for tho they have a fire kindled in the middle of the hut, yet that can give her but little warmth. After her delivery, her firſt reſtorative and cordial, is a good draught of Whales
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98689:68"/>fat, which they procure out of <hi>Norway,</hi> the taſt of which is as ſtrong and ill ſavoured as of a Sea-calves lard, when dried. The child, as ſoon as brought forth is waſhed over as in other Countries, but it is a peculiar cuſtom of the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> that firſt they do it with cold water or ſnow, and then afterwards dip them in hot water, when it begins to fetch its wind, and can ſcarcely draw breath. And alſo they uſe to dip in the water all the other parts of the body, the head only excepted; They heat water, ſaies <hi>Sam: Rheen,</hi> in a Caldron, and in that they ſet the infant ſtreight up to his neck, but they let no water come upon his head, before ſuch time as he is bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by the Prieſt. The new born Babe is inſtantly wrapped up in an Hares skin, inſtead of linnen ſwadling clothes.</p>
               <p>The woman lying in, hath her peculiar place aſſigned her in the hut where ſhe lodges, till ſhe recover her health. And it is juſt by the door u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually on the left hand: there is no other reaſon given for it then that this part of the hut is leſs frequently diſturb'd by company, and there they have all things needfull for them adminiſtred. Tho this ſeldom reſort thither be rather, by reaſon of the womans lying in in that place, either becauſe they would not diſturb her with their company, or, which I rather ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, becauſe they look upon her at that time as unclean. But the women of <hi>Lapland</hi> ſeldom keep their beds long after their delivery, and in that while are extraordinary carefull touching the Baptiſm of their Infants: for after they began more diligently to be inſtructed in the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, they take the greateſt pains imaginable to have their Children bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed as ſoon as poſſibly may be. In former times it was otherwiſe, moſt of them then were baptized very late, and at their mature age; ſome deferred it for altogether. Of this <hi>Gustavus</hi> the firſt is a witneſs, in his Charter, the words whereof I have cited elſewhere. As touching the former <hi>Gustavus Adol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> in an other Charter and Preface, premiſed to that which he publiſhed <hi>Anno</hi> 1634, in which the State of the Religion in <hi>Lapland</hi> is declared at large; Baptiſm, ſaies he, is adminiſtred indeed to them but only at Winter. if their young children can live till then, it is well; if not, they die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Baptiſm. Some of their children come to years of Diſcretion before it, ſo that with thoſe that are grown up, there is no ſmall paines to be taken when they are to be baptized. The time of Baptiſm being the Winter time, was becauſe they have Sermons then preached to them, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament adminiſtred, and that no oftner then twice; once about New-years-day, and againe at Lady-day, of which I have treated in another place. Before theſe times there was not ſo much done as that, but the <hi>Laplanders</hi> were fain to come with their Children to the neighbouring Churches of the <hi>Swedes</hi> in <hi>Angermannia</hi> and <hi>Bothnia,</hi> of which <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> muſt be underſtood to ſpeak, when he ſaies Lib. 4. c. 17. Once or twice in a year they viſit the Baptiſmall Churches, and bring along with them their ſucking Babes in Baskets tied to their backs, to be baptized. But at this day thoſe women that are able, and not impeded by ſome grievous ſickneſs, carry their Children to the Prieſt themſelves, about a fourtnight after their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, that by him they may receive Baptiſm. So much good hath building Churches in <hi>Lapland</hi> done, and having Sermons there, not in a ſtrange Tongue, but the <hi>Laplanders</hi> proper own: and ſo zealous are they for haſtening their Childrens Baptiſm, that the Mother ſcarce lying in above
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98689:69"/>a week or fortnight, after her delivery, will undertake a moſt tedious journy, over the tops of Mountains, thorough wide Marſhes and high Woods with her Infant to the Prieſt; for the women of this Country are naturally hardy, and able to endure any thing without trouble, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, tho they feed upon courſe food in their ſickneſſes, and drink nothing elſe but water, yet they recover again quickly. They carry their young Infants to the Prieſt, one way in the Summer time, and another way in the Winter. In Winter they lay it upon a ſledge. In Summer they put it in a Pannier faſtned to the back of a Rain-deer. The Infant is not ſet upon the back of the Raindeer, but is tied in his cradle, and faſtned to the pack ſaddle after this faſhion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> makes them put in Baskets, as his words afore quoted do intimate, and thoſe Baskets too to be tied at their backs; and the Picture he makes of them repreſents not only the woman, but the man too ſo laden, each with two Children a piece: ſo that together they travell with four Children, and with wooden ſhoes on their feet; but here I am afraid the Painter followed his own fancy too much. Certain it is that the Baskets there repreſented, bear no reſemblance to thoſe of <hi>Lapland.</hi> The <hi>Laplanders</hi> are wholly ignorant of this ſort of Baskets, that are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried at ones back. Nor are their Baskets like wooden ſquare Boxes, ſuch as his figure repreſents them, but of a round compaſs, and one part ſhut down upon the other, as I have ſaid elſewhere. But to return to their Baptiſm, in it they give their Children names, according to the names of ſome of their friends and kindred. <hi>Samuel Rheen</hi> adds that they affect to put Pagan names upon them, ſuch as <hi>Thor, Guaarm, Finne, Pagge;</hi> but that the Prieſts avert them from ſo doing as much as poſſibly they can. And this is peculiar with them, that they often change their names, and put others upon them then thoſe that were given them at their Baptiſm, for the love they bear to ſome friend or kinſman deceaſed, whoſe memory thereby they deſire to preſerve. <hi>Tornaeus</hi> too avouches the ſame thing, and if at any time in their younger years they fall into ſickneſs, then they uſe the name given
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98689:69"/>them in Baptiſm inſtead of a ſurname, eſpecially they obſerve this in boies. But altho the <hi>Laplanders</hi> wives are hardy, ſo as to be able to undertake a journy a week or two after their delivery, and to go about other emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, tho they have made their public appearance, and have been church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Prieſt, yet by their husbands they are looked upon as unclean, till ſix weeks be accompliſhed, ſo that they admit of no familiarity or conjugal ſociety with them for all that ſpace of time. And thus much of their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing.</p>
               <p>I proceed next to their Education of them, the firſt thing that occurs here is their Nurſing, which is alwaies by their own Mothers milk, for the <hi>Laplanders</hi> make no uſe of Nurſes. And this they do not only for ſome ſmall time, but uſuall for two years, three or four together; but if ſickneſs or any other occaſion happen, ſo that they cannot themſelves ſuckle their young ones, they give them the Rain-deers milk, which is groſſer and thicker, then they can well draw out of a ſuck-bottle, (as at ſometimes they are accuſtomed to do, elswhere) and for that reaſon, if the neceſſity be urgent they give it in a ſpoon. Beſides their Mothers milk, they inſtantly accuſtom their young Infants, to eat fleſh, for they thruſt into their mouths a piece of Rain-deers fleſh, that they may ſuck the gravie out of it, and ſo get nuriſhment.</p>
               <p>The rocking the infant in his cradle, follows next, whereby they get him a ſleep. Their Cradles are made of the ſtock of a tree hollowed, like a boat: theſe they cover with leather, and at the head they erect an arched kind of roof, of leather likewiſe. In ſuch a cradle they lay &amp; tie in the Infant, without any linnen clothes or ſheets, inſtead of which they lay him on a ſort of ſoft moſs, of a red color, which they dry in Summer, and have great plenty of it. When the Infant is to be rocked, they let the cradle hang by a rope from the roof of the hut, and by thruſting the cradle and toſſing it from one ſide to the other, they lull him a ſleep. They uſe likewiſe to pleaſe their young children with ſome certain baubles, for at their cradles they tie ſome rings of Alchamy, to make a noiſe and clinking. To theſe rings which ſerve inſtead of rattles they moreover add ſome emblems, wherewith their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may be timely admoniſhed of their condition and future duty. If it be a boy, they hang up at his cradle a bow and arrows, and a ſpear made very artificially out of Rain-deers horn, whereby they ſignifie, that their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren muſt diligently practiſe to be expert and ready in uſing the bow and ſpear. If it be a girle; the wings, feet, and beak of a white Partridge, which they call <hi>Smaeripa,</hi> and is call'd <hi>Lagopus</hi> having feet like the feet of an hare, thereby implying, that their Daughters muſt carefully learn to be cleanly, and like thoſe birds nimble and active. As ſoon as the children come to ſome age, they inſtruct them in all neceſſary arts, the Fathers the boies, the Mothers the girles, for they have no School-maſters among them, but each perſon is his own childerns Maſter, and they are ſo far put on by their parents as to be able to perform any works in uſe among them. Their boies they cheifly teach the Art of Shooting, and hitting marks with an arrow, becauſe in old time they were neceſſitated to get their living by the help of bow and arrows, whereas the greateſt part of them maintain themſelves by hunting, and therefore when they have practiſed never ſo little the uſe of the bow, the boies victuals are kept from them, till they can
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98689:70"/>hit a mark with an arrow, and as it was the cuſtom anciently among the <hi>Baleares,</hi> and ſo now among the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> their boies earn their food every day by their dexterity in ſhooting, and thereby at laſt they prove moſt excellent marks-men. <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> makes mention of this their practice, and wonderfully extolls their dextrouſneſs herein, and avers that he himſelf has ſeen ſome of them who could exactly hit a farthing or a nedle, ſet at ſuch a diſtance off as would juſt let them ſee it. On the boies, that they may take more care to hit the mark, when they have hit it, they beſtow a white girdle, wherein they take huge delight, and ſometime a new bow. But as the <hi>Laplanders</hi> do look to their children in time to teach them arts requiſite to get their living, ſo alſo to provide them means to maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves withal, where it will not be impertinent to mention, that tis a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom with them to beſtow upon their infant a female Rain-deer, ſoon after its birth or Baptiſm, if it be of female Sex, and upon the horns of it they ingrave her mark, ſo to prevent all controverſies or quarrels, that may ariſe concerning her right. She receives likewiſe another, when ſhe cuts her firſt tooth. Which they call <hi>Pannikeis,</hi> that is, the tooth Rain-deer. <hi>John Tornaeus</hi> writes as if theſe gifts were given only by women. The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſaies he, that firſt ſpies a tooth in his mouth, is fain to honor him with a preſent of a Rain-deers Calve. This cuſtom might probably have its riſe thus, becauſe, when the infants have gotten teeth, they have need of more ſolid meat, therefore they ſtock them with Rain-deer as being their cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt food. That Rain-deer then, and whatever encreaſe comes of it, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to the future uſes of the child, as may appear by what we have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſaid, in the Chapter of their marriages, and ſo likewiſe of the other Rain-deer which parents give the child beſides, for tis uſual among them to ſuperadd one to the former, and this they call <hi>Waddom,</hi> that is, the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven one. And this is the chief care of the Parents towards their children, but if they die, inſtead of them are ſubſtituted Guardians, as among other nations, out of their neareſt kindred, who manage all theſe affairs for them.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXVII.</hi> Of their Diſeaſes, Death and Burial.</head>
               <p>THO the <hi>Laplanders</hi> lead a miſerable and hardy kind of life, yet they enjoy their health perfectly well. They have not ſo much as heard of moſt diſeaſes, and are not all infected with thoſe, that elswhere uſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populate whole Countries. There are no acute and burning feavers among them, no plague. And if any infection be brought among them, it inſtantly loſes its force. Some years ſince an infection was brought into <hi>Lapland</hi> in hemp, but none were burt by it, beſides the women that in ſpinning chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, for the Northern cold eaſily diſſipates the poiſonous vapors. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and frequent diſeaſe among them is, ſore eies, from whence not ſeldom proceeds blindneſs. The cauſe of this may be, that from their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie they for the moſt part are forced to be in ſmoak, wherewith their Huts
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98689:70"/>are fill'd both in Summer and Winter. <hi>Ericus Plantinus</hi> gives the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and moreover adds the light of the fire to be a cauſe of it. And this gives them the greateſt trouble imaginable, that their old age uſually ends in blindneſs. They are often troubled alſo with the Pleureſy and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the lungs, ſtiches in the back, and dizzineſs in the head. The ſmall Pox likewiſe ſometimes takes them. Now as diſeaſes are rare among them, ſo Phyſick is altogether unknown. Againſt all diſeaſes inwardly they uſe the root of a kind of Moſs, which they call <hi>Jereh,</hi> or in the failance of that, the ſtalke of <hi>Angelica,</hi> which they call <hi>Fadno,</hi> and is any where to be found. For this uſe they boil the <hi>Angelica</hi> with the whey of Rain-deers milk, as I ſaid it was a cuſtom among them before, in the Chapter of their food, and ſo prepared it is made uſe of as a ſpecial Medicine. If they feel any pain in their joints, they apply ſome fired chips to the place ill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that the ulcer then made may attract the vicious humors, and ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate the paine.</p>
               <p>They cure wounds with no other ointment or plaiſter then of reſin, which the trees ſweat out: if a member be benummed with cold, the Cheeſe made of Rain-deers milk affords the preſenteſt remedy to it; they thruſt a red-hot iron into it, and with the fat of the Cheeſe that inſtantly diſtills from it, they anoint the part affected with incredible ſucceſs. Others ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Cheeſe it ſelf, ſlicing it thin like a plate or leafe. This Cheeſe ſo boiled in milk is extraordinary good fora cough, and what other diſtempers, either of lungs or breaſt ariſe from cold, if it be taken ſo heated. It helps the ſtomach when diſaffected by their drinking water. Becauſe diſeaſes are ſo rare among them, moſt of themcome to extreme old age. Nay <hi>Sam. Rheen</hi> ſaies there are ſome among them that live to be above an hundred years old, and that moſt of them uſually reach 70, 80, and 90 years, and at this age he ſaies many of themare ſtill ſufficiently brisk and lively, able to manage their buſineſs with expedition, to take a journey, to courſe thorough Woods and Mountains, and to perform other ſuch labour: and laſtly that they grow not grey-haired either ſoon or eaſily; ſo that old age diſpatches more of them then diſeaſes do. But if any be ſo dangerouſly ſick as to keep his bed, either worn with age, or ſome diſtemper, they firſt enquire concerning him by their Drum, whither he will recover his health againe or die, as I have in another place ſhewn this to be one of the uſes of the Drum, and <hi>Cl. M. Matthias Steuchius</hi> in his Letter to me tells us the ſame; <hi>I remember,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>I was once told by a</hi> Laplander <hi>that they can tell the very houre and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of any mans death by thoſe their Drums.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When they perceive any one neer death, then if there be preſent any well diſpoſed perſons, and verſed in the Chriſtian Religion, they exhort him in his agonies to think of God and Chriſt. If they are regardleſs of Religion, they inſtantly abandon the ſick perſon, carefull only about the funeral banquet, which they begin ſometimes to celebrate before the perſon departing is quite dead. <hi>Steuchius</hi> confirms this by a Story; There was a rich <hi>Laplander</hi> named <hi>Thomas,</hi> who when he was taken with a dangerous fitt of fickneſs, ſo as to looſe all hope of recovery, he ſummond before him his friends and acquaintance; they when they perceived him to be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, they haſted to the Victuallers that keeps the Inn towards <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Jamptland,</hi> and of him they bought Ale and ſpirit of Wine ready to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98689:71"/>ſacrifice over their friend, whilſt he was alive: when they had ſpent a whole day in qnaffing, they camme to the ſick mans Hut, and by that time found him quite dead. This is an example of the lateſt date, that hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in theſe our daies, from whence we may learn how juſt and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the complaints were, which were premiſed to the Charter of <hi>Guſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus Aldophus,</hi> concerning the <hi>Lapland</hi> School. Furthermore, it is cuſtomary if any die, of whatever diſtemper, all inſtantly forſake the Cottage where the departed perſon lies; for they imagine (which is elſewhere ſhewn) that there ſurvives ſomething of the deceaſed, ſuch as the ancient <hi>Latins</hi> called <hi>Manes.,</hi> and that that was not alwaies benign, but ſometimes hurtfull: for this reaſon they are afraid of the corps of the deceaſed. And if the perſon departed were of the richer ſort: they wrap his corps in a linnen garment, if a poor mean man, in a woollen tattered one, ſo as to cover over as well the head, as all the other parts of the body, this they call <hi>Waldmar.</hi> So indeed do they that are more obſervant of the Chriſtian rites then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary there; as for the others, they cover their dead with their own veſtments, and thoſe too the beſt they had when alive, as <hi>N. Matthias Steuchius</hi> aſſures me by a Letter, and confirms it too by a late example that a perſon worthy to be credited, related to him by an Inhabitant of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſaok,</hi> a near neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to <hi>Lapland. The body of the dead,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>they cover with the best garments he had alive, and ſhut it up in a Biere.</hi> They lay the corps ſo wrap'd up in a Coffin, or funeral Cheſt, which is done by one peculiarly intreated to undertake the employment, and who muſt receive of the neareſt kinſman to the deceaſed perſon a ring of Alchimy, and wear it faſtned to his right arm. Twe reaſon of ſo tying this ring is, becauſe they beleive it to be a preſervative againſt the harm the Manes of the deceaſed perſon may other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe bring upon them, for this reaſon he is fain to wear this ſame ring till the Burial be over, I ſuppoſe, becauſe then they think the ghoſt may be more quiet, which is the ancient ſuperſtition as well of <hi>Greeks</hi> as <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> The Coffin is uſually made of the hollowed trunk of a tree, when they have not wherewithall to make a Coffin, as is common with them that dwell in the barren Mountains near <hi>Norway,</hi> they lay the corps of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed on a Carr or Sledge, which they call <hi>Akia,</hi> inſtead of a Coffin. The place of their Buriall in ancient times, before they turned Chriſtians, was the firſt convenient place they met withall for that purpoſe, eſpecially a Wood. As for them that dwell at a conſiderable diſtance from the Church at this day, they leave not off the cuſtom of burying them any where where they firſt light, with the Sledge too, eſpecially if there are only bare Rocks, and no Trees to be ſeen. Others on every ſide beſet the Sledge with the corps too with ſtocks of Trees, both above and below, on each ſide, ſo as that it may not contract filthineſs or moulder, nor the corps be torn in pieces, or devoured by wild Beaſts.</p>
               <p>There are ſome beſides that lay them in Caves, and ſtop up the mouths of them with ſtones. But what <hi>Peucer</hi> writes that they dig a hole, and lay their dead bodies under their hearth, thereby to eſcape the hauntings of Ghoſts, that is neither known nor heard of by the <hi>Laplanders:</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">Whereas ſaies he, they are ſtrangely frightned and haunted with the Ghoſts of their kindred after death, they provide againſt that by burying their bodies under their hearths: by this only remedy they guard and protect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98689:71"/>againſt the hauntings and affrightments of Demons, this if they do, no ghoſts afterwards appear; if they neglect to do it, they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually interrupted and infeſted with the apparitions of their too offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious kindred.</q> They are ſo far from burying the corps under the hearth that they rather remove them to as great a diſtance as they can, But it is a ſingular and memorable paſſage, that thoſe eſpecially who are leſs obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Chriſtian rites, do uſe to bury with their deceaſed, firſt an hatchet, and next a ſlint and ſteel, of which ceremony they give this account, that if they ever come to riſe againe in that darkneſs they ſhall have great need of ſpringing a light; to which the ſlint and ſteel may help them, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there will be occaſion for a ready way, wherein they may travell to Heaven, to which purpoſe their hatchet may ſtand them inſtead, them eſpecially that are buried among thick Woods, that if any Trees obſtruct their paſſage, they may cut them down. And this do they themſelves at this day affirm, now they have heard of a laſt day, and a Reſurrection of the dead. But I ſuppoſe it rather to be an ancient ſuperſtition remaining ſtill in theſe Countries, nor uſed only by the <hi>Laplanders.</hi> I my ſelf ſaw ſome few miles diſtant from <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal,</hi> raked out of the Sepulcher of a famous perſon, the great Treaſurer of this Kingdom, <hi>M. Steno Bielke,</hi> a ſteel and flint; which that it was a relique only of Paganiſm, not the place only, but Tomb over him did ſufficiently teſtify. It is certain that it was the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient perſuaſion of Pagans, that there was no other way for the dead to arrive at the abodes of the Bleſſed, but thorough darkneſs, which they are the more afraid of, becauſe it is the nature of their Country to have thicker darkneſs and of more durance then is uſual among others. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the hatchet, it is no wonder, whereas in other places it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived cuſtom to lay by dead People their Weapons, of which the principal one, among the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> is the hatchet. As for what appertains to the modern <hi>Laplanders, Olaus Petri</hi> imagines that they bury theſe things with their dead, becauſe they beleive that after the Reſurrection they ſhall take the ſame courſe of life they lead before, and for that reaſon they furniſh them with the ſame utenſils. Thus do they who are leſs obſervant of the Chriſtian ceremonies, and dwell fartheſt off from the Chriſtian Churches. The others take ſpecial care to have their dead carried to the Church-yard, which too the Prieſts do earneſtly requeſt of them. It is ſaid too that ſome of them, when they have bin accuſtomed to bury in ſuch a place are ſo ambitious as to give money to have their deceaſed bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried not in the Yard, but the Church.</p>
               <p>But here none of the <hi>Laplanders</hi> will willingly dig up a grave, unleſs he be extraordinary poor, ſuch whom the richer of them hire at a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rate to ſuch an emploiment, or ſome other of <hi>Swedland,</hi> whom they can procure. So the deceaſed perſon is buried according to the Chriſtian rite, when they have mourned for him, putting on the worſt clothes they have, that is peculiar to them, that they leave behind them the ſledg whereon the courſe was brought to the Church-yard and all the veſtments wherein the deceaſed lay during ſickneſs, theſe they bring to the Sepulcher, for fear I ſuppoſe leſt any deadly thing ſhould cling to them, and that cannot be uſed by others without harm. So when the Perſon is buried, a funeral ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet is provided, the time of it is uſually, the third day after the burial,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98689:72"/>the banquet is furniſhed out of the fleſh of the Rain-deer; that drew the perſon departed to his Burial place. That they ſacrifice in honor of him, and all the kindred and acquaintance feaſt upon it. At this feaſt they take ſpecial care, not to looſe the bones, but gather them all up diligently, and lay them in a coffer and bury them under ground; if they have the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of procuring Spirit of Wine, they drink it about to the memory of the perſon deceaſed, and call it <hi>Saligawiin,</hi> that is the Wine of the bleſſed, meaning, I ſuppoſe that they drink it to the memory of him, that is happy by his departure from earth: however it happened, that thoſe kinſmen of <hi>Thomas</hi> the <hi>Laplander,</hi> as was above mentioned, made this feaſt before the due time. They faſten upon the coffer, wherein they ſhut up the Rain-deers bones, the image of a man faſhioned out of wood, bigger or leſs in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the deceaſed perſon; thus much of their funeral rites. Only ſome of the richer ſort repeat the feaſt every year, in the manner aforeſaid, where may note, that the Rain-deers are not only ſlain for their buſineſs of the feaſt, but likewiſe in manner a Sacrifice, and that the bones are offered to the Manes of the deceaſed, at tis more largely treated of in another place. It moreover is apparent that the <hi>Laplanders</hi> time of mourning is not uſed to be ſhort, but of a long continuance, eſpecially for the loſs of married perſons or children, and conſiſts not in oſtentation, or appearance, but only in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſorrow. I come now to their manner of inheritance and diviſion of their goods, which follows upon the death of any one, for the <hi>Laplanders</hi> likewiſe have their ſort of riches, conſiſting moſt in moveables as cattle, ſilver, braſs and copper veſſels and the like, but there is nothing for which they are more eſteemed then plenty of Rain-deer. Some of them have a hundred, ſome a thouſand or more; <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> makes mention of but half theſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers <hi>Lib.</hi> 17. <hi>Cap.</hi> 28. but what may be read in the papers of <hi>John Buraeus,</hi> confirms their number to be much greater. <hi>Oroveen,</hi> tis there ſaid, was ſo rich in Rain-deer, that their number could not be known. <hi>Arent Juſtinus</hi> ſtole a hundred of them, and yet they could not be miſſed. And other things which ſerve for daily uſes, they keep in public, or elſe lay up in their cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boards, as I have elſewhere ſhown, but they bury under ground either ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver plate or mony, and the place they call <hi>Roggri,</hi> they lay it firſt in a cloſe box, that in a copper kind of kettle, and that they cover over with boord, and ſo ſtrew it over with earth and moſs, that no body may perceive any thing to be hid there, this they do ſo privatly, that neither their wives nor children can tell any thing of it, ſo that it ſometimes chances, that, when they dy ſuddenly, all theſe things ly buried and never come to the heirs, but what come to their hands are thus divided among them, if they be movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the Brother receives two thirds, the Siſter one, as was appointed by the Provincial Laws of the <hi>Swedes.</hi> The two <hi>Rain-deers</hi> given to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in their tender years, the one the Tooth Rain-deer, the other the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents free gift, are exempted from this common diviſion, as likewiſe their increaſe, which ſometimes comes to a conſiderable number. If the goods be not moveables, as territories, lakes, mountains and ſuch like, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of either Sex, poſſeſs them with equall right, and make uſe of them indifferently, tho this be not a bare permiſſion, but founded in the diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Lapland,</hi> made by <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, in which to every family were given its own territories, Lakes, Woods, Mountains, and the like, as has
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98689:72"/>been mentioned in another place, from whence I ſuppoſe tis, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſtill to each ſingle family, and are not liable to diviſion or to be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted among the heirs as other goods; for theſe are not their own proper poſſeſſions, as other goods are, but only granted from the crown of <hi>Swed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to them to receive the profits, and upon that ſcore every year they pay a certain tribute, which we have treated of before, ſo that there remains nothing elſe to be added here.</p>

               <p>Moreover the beaſt is naturally wild, and ſuch ſtill abound in <hi>Lapland,</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:98689:73"/>but now multitudes are tamed for domeſtick ſervice; thoſe that are bred of tame ones, remain ſo, of which there is great plenty. There is a third ſort bred of the wild and tame, for they uſe, as <hi>Sam. Rheen</hi> obſerves, to ſet out tame Does about rutting time, for the better conveniency of catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wild ones. Thence it happens that ſometimes the tame ones breed that third ſort, which they call particularly <hi>Kattaigiar</hi> or <hi>Purach,</hi> and are bigger and ſtronger than the reſt, and ſitter to draw Sledges. He ſaies too that they retain ſomething of their primitive wildeneſs, ſometimes being very he adſtrong, and kicking at him that ſits on the Sledge. The driver hath no remedy then but to turn his Cart, and lie under it, till the Beaſt ceaſes to be unruly, for they are ſtrong, and will not be governed with whips. They go a rutting about S. <hi>Matthews</hi> tide, in the ſame manner that Staggs do: if any Buck be killed in that Seaſon, the fleſh ſtinks like a Goats, which makes the Inhabitants deſiſt from killing them at that time, but at other times they are good meat. The Does (which they call <hi>Waijar</hi>) are big ten months, they calve about <hi>May,</hi> when they can recruit themſelves with the Sun, and freſh graſs. They breed but one a piece, but are ſo fertile, that of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred there is not ten barren. Thoſe that have calved are ſtiled <hi>Raonae,</hi> which become exceeding fleſhy, as if they were farned againſt Autumn, at which time they are uſualy killed.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that have young ones never are houſed, but give ſuck without, and in this caſe the great multitude breeds no confuſion, for each Doe knows her proper Calf, and is known by it; ſo ſaies <hi>Sam. Rheen,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms that they know one another after two or three years abſence. When the Calves are grown they feed on graſs and leaves, and what the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains afford: their color is mixt of red and yellow. About S. <hi>James</hi> tide they caſt their hair, which in the next growth turns blackiſh. They are at their full growth in 4 years, each year changing their name: the firſt, they are ſtiled <hi>Namiloppa,</hi> i. e. nameleſs. <hi>Tornaeus</hi> calls the Buck <hi>Hiroas,</hi> but <hi>Rheen</hi> gives him the name of <hi>Herki.</hi> When they are able to work, they are tamed; one ſort being condemned to the Sledge, and thence named <hi>Vaijom-herki,</hi> others to carry burdens, thence calle <hi>Lykam-herki.</hi> Thoſe that are deſign'd for labour they commonly gueld, which renders them more tractable: this is done when they are a year old. Thoſe which are reſerved for breeding, are called <hi>Servi.</hi> The Bucks are not ſo numerous as the Does, of which there be an hundred for twenty, which are profitable for Milk, Cheeſe and breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Both men and women milk them kneeling, one hand being emploied to hold the pail, and the other the dugg. They milk them ſometimes looſe, and ſometimes bound to a poſt, about 2 or 3 of the clock in the evening, and but once a day, the reſt being reſerved for the calves: thoſe which have Calves alwaies yield moſt milk: the greateſt quantity they give at once is a Swediſh pint and half, that is about the fourth part of the ordinary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon the <hi>Rhine.</hi> The milk is fat and thick, and very nuriſhing, which is their chiefeſt food; that which they do not boil they make Cheeſe of, which is thus deſcribed by <hi>Rheen.</hi> The Dairy-Maids firſt let the milk ſtand to cream, when it hath ſtood they take off the cream with a skimmer. When one Cheeſefat is filled, they fill another, and put it on the firſt, and ſo till 6 or 8 are ſilled, then they turn the Cheeſefats, that the lowermoſt be in the top, and uſe not their hands to preſs the Cheeſe, but let them preſs
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98689:74"/>each other. Each Cheeſe requires as much milk as ten Rain-deers can ſpare: their ſhape is round about two fingers thick, and as big as a Trencher, which we uſe at table, their Milk makes very fat Cheeſe, but no Butter, inſtead of which they have a kind of tallow, as I ſhew'd before.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Laplanders</hi> having ſuch advantages from theſe beaſts, take great care in driving them to their Meadows, and defending them from wild Beaſts. They are ſo concerned for them, that they bring their Wives, Children, and Servants, to watch them in the paſtures, and drive thoſe that wander back to the Herd. When milking time comes, they drive them into folds, which are ſpots of ground, hedged in with hurdles ſtuck on forks, each fold having two doors, one by which they enter, the other which carries them out into their Medows. Their meat in Summer is the beſt graſs the Mountains afford, with leaves of young Trees. They avoid all hard rough graſs, eſpecially where Bullruſhes grow. The other Seaſons of the year they feed on a kind of white Moſs, which abounds in <hi>Lapland:</hi> when the Mountains are covered with Snow, they ſcrape out this Moſs with their feet. And <hi>S. Rbeen</hi> obſerves that tho they get leaſt food in the Winter quarter, they grow whiter and fatter then at other times, for in Summer the exceſſive heat makes them worſe. Theſe Cattel too are ſubject to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, which if once begun, ſpread and kill the whole Herd, but this very rarely. They are infected with that more frequently, which <hi>Olaus</hi> deſcribes. About <hi>March</hi> worms or wornels do begin to breed in their backs, which when alive, creep out and make the Beaſts skin, if then killed, full of holes, like a Seive, and almoſt uſeleſs.</p>
               <p>The Wolves trouble them, tho they have their horns to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but they are not alwaies ſo armed, for they caſt their horns once a year, which grow again very ſlowly. The Does never caſt theirs till they have calved. The Rain-deers uſe not their horns when they encounter the Wolves ſo much as their forefeet, with theſe they receive them coming on, otherwiſe their feet defend them by flight, which they can eaſily do, if not hindred by Snow. The third inconveniency is that if they be not very carefully lookt to, they will wander and be loſt, therefore the owners put certain marks on them to diſtinguiſh them from others; their marks they put ſometimes on their ears, and not their horns, becauſe they caſt them. But if they eſcape all accidents whatever, they never live above 10 years.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the Rain-deers, which alone ſupply the want of Horſes, Sheep, and other Cattel. Therefore the Inhabitants apply themſelves only to the care of theſe, neglecting all the reſt; beſides Dogs, which faithfully watch their Houſes and Cattel, and are very ſerviceable for hunting, as I have mentioned in that Chapter.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XXIX.</hi> Of the wild Beaſts of the <hi>Laplanders.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>OF all the Beaſts in <hi>Lapland</hi> the Bear is chief: him ſaies <hi>Sam. Rheen,</hi> they ſtile King of the Woods, and gives this reaſon, becauſe in ſtrength and fierceneſs he exceeds all the reſt. They are very numerous, ſome fiercer than others, eſpecially thoſe which are mark't with a white wreath about their necks, many of which are found in the North. Theſe annoy the Inhabitants Cattel, and overturn their Stores; which they ſix on the top of a Tree, to preſerve their fleſh and fiſh, and all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns proviſion: but in one night the Bear deſtroys all the food they have laid up.</p>
               <p>Next the Bear the Elk is remarkable, which <hi>Olaus</hi> calls the wild Aſſe, <hi>Scaliger</hi> confounds it with the Rain-deer, for he ſaies, tho it had Aſſes hair, it was called by the <hi>Swedes, Ranger,</hi> by the <hi>Goths, Rangifer,</hi> by the <hi>Germans, Ellend,</hi> by the <hi>Moſcovites, Lozzi,</hi> and ſome Books ſay that in <hi>Norway</hi> they were named <hi>Rehen:</hi> what Books he means I am ignorant, but I am ſure the <hi>Elks,</hi> which the <hi>Germans</hi> call <hi>Ellend,</hi> were never called <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen,</hi> but <hi>Aelg,</hi> or <hi>Aelgar,</hi> which is now the common name through all the North; neither can I think otherwiſe of the <hi>Moſcovites Lozzi,</hi> for it is the ſame with the <hi>Lithuanian Loſſo,</hi> as <hi>Herbeſtenius</hi> obſerves. That which the <hi>Lithuanians</hi> call <hi>Loſs,</hi> the <hi>Germans</hi> call <hi>Ellend,</hi> and many in Latin <hi>Alce.</hi> So that <hi>Loſs, Lozzi, Aelg, Ellend</hi> is the ſame Beaſt, but quite different from the Rain-deer, contrary to what <hi>Scaliger</hi> thought. For firſt it excells the Rain-deers in bulk not a little, being as high as any Horſe: its horns are ſhorter, but above two palms in breadth, ſhooting out a few, tho not many young ſprouts. His leggs are not round, but long, eſpecially the foremoſt: he engages very ſmartly, and his ſharp hoofs enable him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter all Men and Dogs that oppoſe. He hath a long head, and huge thick lips alwaies hanging down; his color is not ſo white, but all over his body it inclines to a dark yellow mixt with aſhen: when he walks he makes no noiſe with his hoofs as all Rain-deers do; whoever ſees both Beaſts (as I have often) will perceive ſuch difference, that he will wonder how any one ſhould miſtake. There is no great breed of theſe in <hi>Lapland,</hi> but they have them from other places, eſpecially <hi>Lithuania. Charles</hi> the ninth, by a public Proclamation claimed all the skins of thoſe that were killed for his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, as I mentioned in another place. <hi>Olaus</hi> ſaies that they continue altogether in the South of <hi>Lapland,</hi> and are taken moſt frequently by running them down, or hunting; in other places they are rarely found: but it is manifeſt that twice a year they ſwim in great Herds out of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relia,</hi> over the River <hi>Niva,</hi> to wit, in the Spring to go into <hi>Carelia,</hi> and in Autumn to return into <hi>Ruſſia.</hi> Some few Stags have bin ſeen in <hi>Lapland. S. Rheen</hi> mentioning the chief Beaſts which have bin found there, reckons ſeverall ſpecies of four-footed Beaſts, as wild Rain-deers, Bears, Stags,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98689:75"/>Wolves, Gluttons, Beavers, Otters, Martins, Squirrels; but theſe Stags are but few and little, ſuch as they call <hi>Damacervi,</hi> or <hi>Platicerotes,</hi> which ſince they have nothing peculiar from thoſe in other Nations, let it ſuffice that they are named. To theſe I may add wild Rain-deers, but becauſe they differ from the tame ones only in bulk, being bigger, and in color ſomewhat blacker, I will likewiſe paſs them over. <hi>Sam. Rheen</hi> after the Stags mentions Wolves, of which there is a great number, diſtinguiſht from thoſe in other Countries only by their color, ſomething whiter, whence they are often called white Wolves: their hair is thicker, longer and rougher. Theſe moſt of all moleſt the Rain-deers, which are armed againſt them with their horns.</p>
               <p>I find in ſome Papers of <hi>Buraeus</hi> that the Wolves did never aſſault the Rain-deer if it was bound to a ſtake: the reaſon may be becauſe he fears ſome trap when he ſees the rope that binds the Raindeer: for the Wolf is a very ſuſpicious creature, and thinks every thing he ſees to be a ſnare to catch him. Beſides he may ſuſpect that men lie hidden to kill him, whereas the Rain-deers are only bound for the better conveniency of milking them. Neverthereſs, the Wolves venture not only on Beaſts, but on Men and Women, eſpecially thoſe that are big with child. Travellers are forced to go armed, particularly Women near their time, for the Wolves take their ſcent and watch more greedily for them, therefore no Woman is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to travell without a guide aſſiſting her. The next are the Gluttons, which are frequent here, they have a round head, ſtrong and ſharp teeth, like a Wolfs, a plump body, and feet ſhorter than the Otters: their skin is of a very dark color, ſome of them reſemble Sables, only they have ſofter and ſiner haire; this Beaſt lives not altogether on Land, but many times in the Water, like the Otter, tho much bigger and ſtronger: ſome compare it to the Otter, but it is far greedier than he, for thence it gets its name. For <hi>Olaus</hi> tells us that it is called by the <hi>Swedes, Jerff,</hi> by the <hi>Germans, Wildfras:</hi> but this German name doth not denote the Beaſt to eat much, but to devour what it finds in the Woods, for <hi>wild</hi> ſignifies any thing in the Woods; wherefore either <hi>Scaliger</hi> did not underſtand the word, or elſe the Printer did not follow his copy: which appears more plainely, from that the <hi>Gulo</hi> doth not only infeſt wild Beaſts, but tame (as hath bin often known in <hi>Swedland</hi>) and Water creatures too, being it ſelf accuſtomed to the Waters.</p>
               <p>There are abundance of Beavers in <hi>Lapland,</hi> becauſe the Nation abounds with plenty of Fiſh, whence they have ſtore of food: <hi>Olaus</hi> thinks that the plenty of them proceeds from the quietneſs of the Waters, which are never troubled with Ships, as the <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Danow</hi> are. I add nothing of theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not diſtinguiſh'd from the vulgar ſort, neither are the Otters. Next to theſe <hi>Sam. Rheen</hi> ſpeaks of the Foxes, as being numerous, and of ſeverall ſorts over all <hi>Lapland.</hi> He reckons up, beſides the common ones, thoſe that are black, brown, aſh-colored, white; and thoſe that are marked with a croſs. The black are moſt valued becauſe they are rare: in <hi>Moſcovy</hi> Men of honor and preferment have their Caps made of their skins, which are ſold, as <hi>Herberstenius</hi> obſerves, for 10, ſometimes 15 pieces of gold. Thoſe that are marked with a croſs, <hi>Johnston</hi> calls <hi>Crucigerae,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes them thus: they have from their mouth, over their head and back
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98689:75"/>to their tail a black ſtreak, another croſſing their back, and down to their forefeet, which two lines do reſembleacroſs. Theſe are preferred before the common red Foxes, being bigger, and having thicker hair. The aſhen-colored Foxes are thoſe which <hi>Johnſton</hi> calls <hi>Iſatidae,</hi> their color is mixt of aſh and blew, ſuch as is the color of the woad, tho this color is not ſpread all over his body, nor is any ſingle hair wholly of this color, for the longeſt hairs are black at the end, the ſhorteſt white, from both which this color reſults. <hi>Olaus</hi> calls theſe <hi>Celestine,</hi> or sky-colored Foxes, where too he tells us that they are of leſs worth than the reſt, and the white ones too, becauſe their color is ſo, without the tincture of any other, ſuch as Conies uſe to have. The reaſon is becauſe their number is great, and their hair not durable: but that there is ſuch abundance of theſe skins happens becauſe the Foxes are more eaſily taken, not living in the Woods, but on the naked Mountains between <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Swedland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Foxes the Martins are mentioned. Theſe too are frequent in <hi>Lapland,</hi> and indeed no Nation doth afford more or better skins than this doth. But theſe differ too, thoſe that have yellow on their throat being preferred before the white: but this is obſervable that the <hi>Laplanders</hi> have no Martins but in the Woods, and they have alſo a particular ſort of meat, for they feed on Squirrels and Birds. In the night time, ſaies <hi>Olaus,</hi> by the advantage of their ſharp claws they can eaſily climb any Tree, where they make a prey of the Squirrell, who is quite as nimble, tho not ſo ſtrong, and therefore can ſometimes ſave himſelf by skipping round the arm of a Tree: this the enemy cannot imitate, eſpecially if the Squirrell leads him up to the top branches, otherwiſe he cannot eſcape, and leap from the top of one Tree to another. The Martin is not injurious only to the Squirrel, but to both ſmall and great Birds, which he ſeizes on as they are at rooſt: if they be the greater Birds they preſently betake themſelves to flight with him ſitting on their backs, and perſiſting to bite ſo long, till they drop down dead.</p>
               <p>Next are the Squirrels, which are incredibly numerous. Theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly change their color every year. When Winter draws on they turn from red to griſle, which color is valued in the skin; this color the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Beaſts are Northwards, is the purer, and leſs mixt with red, and is ſo too the farther the Seaſon is from Summer, at which time they are never hunted, but all in the Winter. Tho they do ſo abound, yet they are wont to go away in ſuch troops, till there are ſcarce any left. The reaſon of their departure is not known: ſome think it is becauſe they fear hunger and foreſee the want of meat. Others think it is to avoid the injury of the weather. <hi>Rheen</hi> and <hi>Ol. Pet.</hi> deſcribe their march on this wiſe. They go to the brinks of a River, where they find the bark of Pine, or Birch trees, on which they truſt themſelves, and venture to launch forth, prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their tailes for ſailes. Thus they are carried at the mercy of the wind till it overturns them and their bark. Their body is of that nature that it will not ſink, but being drowned, is driven to ſhore, where very often great numbers are taken up, and their skins, if they are found ſoon enough are as ſit for uſe as ever: but tho ſuch an accident, as this, ſweeps away moſt of them, yet the few that are left preſerve the ſpecies, and multiply very ſoon, for each Squirrel brings forth 4, 5, or more at a time. And thoſe are all the Beaſts which <hi>S. Rheen</hi> mentions.</p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:98689:76"/>
               <p>But beſides theſe, there are others, ſuch as are the <hi>Sables</hi> which <hi>Olaus Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnus</hi> calls <hi>Zabelli,</hi> their skins <hi>Johnſton</hi> in his Hiſtory of Animals commends. <hi>Olaus</hi> ſaith that their skins were made uſe of by the <hi>Lapland</hi> Women, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the Brides to adorn themſelves with them; and that there is but ſmall plenty of them in theſe parts. Some make this beaſt like a weezel, others eſpecially <hi>Scaliger</hi> like the Martin, and indeed he ſeems to be in the right both to the bulk and ſhape of it. Their color the nearer it comes to black is the more eſteemed. There are found ſeveral all white, ſuch as we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſeen the <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Embaſſadors bring over to the King for a moſt ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar preſent. By which <hi>Adamus Bremenſis</hi> in his <hi>Scandinavia</hi> ſeems to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood white Martins. There are alſo Ermins which are found only among the <hi>Laplanders. Jovius</hi> firſt wrote of them that they were good exchange for any ſort of Merchandize. Theſe Ermins are nothing but white weezels having the end of their tails black, <hi>Johnſton</hi> takes notice thereof out of <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi> he calleth the beaſt <hi>Erminius,</hi> which is the ſame thing with <hi>Armelinus</hi> and <hi>Hermelinus,</hi> differing neither in bigneſs nor nature from the weezel, the color argues nothing, for he has that only in Winter, but in Summer is of a bright yellow. It is as greedy of Mice as the Weezels are, whence the <hi>Sweeds</hi> call it <hi>Lekat.</hi> I am unwilling to call it with <hi>Scaliger</hi> a <hi>Swedland</hi> Mouce. Among theſe I had rather reckon a little ſort of beaſt which they call <hi>Lemmus,</hi> which <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> ſaith the Ermins feed on. <hi>Samuel Rheen</hi> ſpeaks of a ſort of Mice found in <hi>Lapland</hi> which they call Mountain Mice or <hi>Lemblar,</hi> which <hi>Wormius</hi> deſcribes with ſhort tails and ſtaring hair, and not unlike a Mouce. I will ſpeak little of their color, which <hi>Olaus</hi> ſaies is various, <hi>Samuel Rheen</hi> affirms it red, who obſerves too that they come of a ſudden, and cover the ground with their multitude. <hi>Olaus</hi> obſerves that this is alwaies in ſtormy weather, and thinks that it rains theſe creatures, but is all together in a doubt, whether they are brought thither by the winds, or bred in the clouds. <hi>Wormius</hi> thinks plainly that they are bred in the clouds: but the learned <hi>Iſaac Voſſius</hi> in his notes to <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> corrects him, and ſaies the reaſon why theſe animals are ſuppoſed to fall from the Clouds is becauſe they uſe not to appear, but immediatly after rain they creep out of their holes, either for that they are ſill'd with water, or becauſe this creature thrives much in rain, which opinion ſeems moſt probable to me. Theſe creatures are very bold, never making their eſcape when Paſſengers come by, but keep on their way, and make a noiſe like the barking of a dog: they fear neither club nor ſword, but if any one ſtrike at them, they turn again and bite. It is obſervable in them that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver go near or do any miſcheif in any hut, ſometimes they ſet upon one another, being divided as it were into two armies, this the <hi>Laplanders</hi> take to be an omen of future war in <hi>Swedland,</hi> and gather whence the enemy will come, by obſerving whence thoſe animals firſt moved that provoked the reſt. Theſe creatures have their enemies too, firſt the Ermines as I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, then the Foxes, which bring a great number of theſe into their holes: hence the <hi>Laplanders</hi> have no ſmall diſadvantage, for the Foxes uſing this ſort of ſood moſt, regard not the baits which they lay to catch them. Thirdly the Rain-deers devour them, and laſtly the dogs which eat only the fore part of them. Theſe creatures never live, if they chance to eat any herb grown after they had taſted it before: ſometimes they periſh
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98689:76"/>otherwiſe, as being choaked in the Hedges or dropping into water. The laſt ſort of beaſts are hares, which are eſteemed for their white skin, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the winter, at which time they are as white as the Foxes; they change their color every year, alwaies turning white towards this ſeaſon; for which tho many reaſons may be given, I think this is moſt conſiderable, that Nature and Providence deſigned it, leaſt when the ground was quite co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with Snow, their color might eaſily diſcover them, and they being equally oppreſſed by man and beaſt ſhould be quite deſtroy'd. For which reaſon too, probably ſome birds at that time are white. <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the ſame of hares, that immediatly after Autumn they begin to grow white, and at that time are frequently taken half white and half not, but in the midſt of the Winter they are all white as before.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXX.</hi> Of their Birds and Fiſh.</head>
               <p>I COME now to the Birds, of which here is great ſtore. <hi>Samuel Rheen</hi> mentions theſe, Swans, Geeſe, Ducks, Lapwings, Snipes, all ſorts of water Birds, and wild fowl, as Heathcocks, Stock-doves, Partridges, Woodcocks; he makes a diſtinction between water fowle and thoſe that are bred in Woods, and proves that they abound with each ſort, becauſe the country has ſo many pools, ponds, and woods. Of theſe birds, ſome are in other countries, ſome only in theſe Northern parts. Swans, Geeſe and Ducks, are known every where: he means wild ducks, for they have no tame ones. <hi>Olaus Petri</hi> takes notice of the ſame thing. It is remarkable in theſe wild ſoul, that they come from the South into the North, where they build their neſts, hatch and breed up their young ones, which is not frequent elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. I believe it is becauſe they do not find ſuch ſecurity nor plenty of food in other places. The Snipes I ſuppoſe are ſcarce found any where elſe, their back and head are black, and moſt part of their wings, white on their breaſt and belly, red bills, very long, and ſet with teeth, ſhort feet and red with skin between their claws, as all water fowle have. As you may ſee in the next page.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>The next is their Fiſh, of which they have incredible ſtore; <hi>Zeiglerus</hi> ſaies their draughts are ſo great, that they are forced to tranſport ſome of them into other Countries. <hi>Jovius</hi> ſpeaks too of great plenty they reap from the Seas, becauſe he is deſcribing thoſe <hi>Laplanders</hi> which live near <hi>Muſcovy</hi> whereas the reſt can have plenty enough out of the rivers. The beſt ſort they have is Salmon, for which <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> ſaith there is not better fiſhing in any part of <hi>Europe,</hi> then in the Bothnic towards <hi>Lapland;</hi> whoſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſend down vaſt rivers of freſh water, againſt which the Salmons come in ſuch ſhoales, and with ſuch vigor, that the Fiſhermen find them at the head of the river on the top of the mountains. <hi>Samuel Rheen</hi> too prefers theſe fiſh before all the reſt, and ſaith that they ſwim up all rivers that they are able, and come down again about S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Matthews</hi> tide. And that it is much worſe when it returns, then when it went up, which ſeems to be, becauſe tis wearied and ſpent in ſtrugling againſt the ſtream, and engendring; which it alwaies does in thoſe parts of the river which are moſt remote from the Sea: when he comes up the river they call him <hi>Salm,</hi> at his return <hi>lax.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> ſort of fiſh are Pikes, <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> ſpeaking of this ſaith, that in <hi>Lapland</hi> there are marſhes of freſh water, 400 <hi>Italian</hi> miles in length, and 100 in bredth, in which there is ſuch abundance of Pike and other fiſh, that they do not only ſupply 4 Kingdomes, but are dried and tranſported farther into <hi>Germany</hi> to be ſold: theſe fiſh alwaies uſe freſh water, and are every where known having long heads, the lower jaw hanging out, many ſharp teeth, which the Germans call <hi>Hecht.</hi> They are found ſometimes to exceed men in length. <hi>Olaus</hi> affirms, that if they have freſh water and food enough, they will attain to 8 foot in length.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:98689:78"/>
               <p>The 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> ſort are thoſe which the <hi>Swedes</hi> call <hi>Syck,</hi> not much differing from the Carp; only they have longer mouths, and not ſo broad, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly not ſo big as carps, but in <hi>Lapland</hi> they are found extraordinary, ſometimes weighing 10 or 12 pounds.</p>
               <p>The 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ſort is <hi>Abbor</hi> which is with us a perch: this is very plentiful too, and frequently of an incredible bigneſs. There is to this day in a Chappel at <hi>Luhlah,</hi> kept one of their heads dried, which is from the top to the under jaw 2 ſpans thick. There are found water-weezels red and white, chiefly in the pools near the Sea. <hi>Samuel Rheen</hi> ſpeaks of 2 ſorts which the <hi>Swedes</hi> call <hi>Raeding,</hi> and <hi>Aerlax;</hi> whether they are any where elſe found I know not. <hi>Rheen</hi> thus deſcribes the firſt ſort. <hi>Raeding,</hi> has its name from the red color on the lower part of its belly. The latter is very like a Salmon but not ſo big. Some take them for Salmons not come to their full growth, but this is an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, for theſe fiſhes are taken in pools, which are on every ſide parted from the Sea, and are known never to have any Salmons. I had rather refer them to the trout, or <hi>Trutta,</hi> becauſe it ſcarce differs in ſhape, only the Trouts fleſh is redder and ſofter. Beſides theſe there are many other fiſh in <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but not regarded, becauſe they ſerve not for food, for which reaſon I paſs them over: only <hi>Olaus Petrus</hi> gives us this doubtful account of their names, <hi>Salario, Cobitis, Barbatula, Rubellio, Borbocha ocutala, Praſinus, Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Cobitis aculeata.</hi> This Country breeds not many reptiles, no ſerpents: but this is meant of the upper Regions towards the <hi>Norway</hi> Mountains, for in the low woody places they are found tho not many. There are but few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects; as for fleas they are quite unknown; but they receive much injury from gnats, which infeſt man and beaſt, eſpecially the Rain-deers, which upon that account are driven away to the top of the higheſt Mountains. The men arm themſelves againſt them by keeping a continual ſmoak in the houſe. If they ſleep, they put a blanket over their body and head: when they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad they put on a garment made of hides, and on their heads cloth caps. I have bin told by the Natives, that many to defend themſelves from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect, dawb their faces all over, except their eies, with refine and pitch.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe, there are great waſps which trouble the Rain-deers, and ſting them ſo deep, that ſometimes they leave marks behind them even when the beaſt is flayed: thoſe little holes which they make with their ſtings the vulgar call <hi>Kaorme.</hi> The only remedy for the Raindeer againſt theſe, is ſmoak, which if not preſent they dip themſelves in water: and let this ſuffice for their Animals.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XXXI.</hi> Of the <hi>Laplanders</hi> Trees and Plants.</head>
               <p>I deſcend from their Animals to their Trees and Plants, with which they are well ſtored, tho <hi>Jovius</hi> obſerves that they have no fruit Trees, as Apple, Pear, &amp;c. neither have they any wild Trees which will not bear the cold, as Oak, Beach, which <hi>Ol. Pet.</hi> takes notice of, but adds that they have plenty of Pine and Fir, Juniper and Birch, Service tree, and Willow, Alder and Dog-tree, the Aſp and Ollar: but theſe Trees do not grow every where, for the Mountains called the <hi>Fells,</hi> between <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Lapland,</hi> bear no Trees at all: <hi>Pet. Claud.</hi> thinks the reaſon of that to be the continual ſtorm of wind that is on them, but perhaps a truer reaſon may be the extremity of cold. The ground that lies near the Mountains is thick ſet with Woods, with this diſtinction that the parts next them bears nothing but Birch tree, remarkable for their thickneſs and height, and pleaſant proſpect, Nature having contrived them ſo regularly that they ſeem afar off to be ſome pleaſant Garden. The ſoil more diſtant from thoſe Hills, beſides Birch-trees, hath Fir and Pitch, which ſeems like ſome new kind of wood, compoſed of theſe three ſorts.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe, there are very few others found in <hi>Lapland.</hi> Shrubs, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially Currans, or Ribes are very frequent, but they regard not theſe becauſe perhaps the taſt is unpleaſant, eſpecially of thoſe which bear Black-berries, which are more numerous than the others. The Junipers grow thick, being very tall and comely. This Country yields all manner of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the chief are thoſe which the <hi>Swedes</hi> call <hi>Hiortron,</hi> ſome Dew-berries, or the <hi>Norway</hi> Berry, whoſe ſpecies is the ſame that grows on Brambles, each Berry being divided as it were into graines of a pale yellow color, beginning to be red as they ripen. Theſe commonly grow in marſhy places. They creep on the ground, and are ſuſtained by little props, ſo that they ought not to be reckoned among ſhrubs. The Berries are very wholſome, and are a preſent remedy for the Scurvy. The Inhabitants delight to eat them with their fleſh and ſalt meats, as I mentioned before. They have a ſort of black Berries, called by the <hi>Swedes, Halton,</hi> according to <hi>Olaus Pet.</hi> alſo the thin leaved heath, that bears a Berry, which ſome call ground Ewe, the <hi>Swedes, Kraokebaer,</hi> the leſſer black Berries called in <hi>Swedland Lingon,</hi> and the leſſer black Berries called <hi>Blaobaer,</hi> all which <hi>Olaus Pet.</hi> takes notice of, ſpeaking of their manner of dreſſing meat, particularly of the Heath-berries: whence it appears that theſe Berries were as plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull with them as the former. They have all ſorts of other Berries, tho the Natives do not ſo much value them. This Country affords very uſefull Herbs, ſuch as are Angelica, which the Inhabitant value ſo much that they call it the <hi>Lapland</hi> herb, or Samigraes: they are much pleaſed with it in their meat: it grows with a ſhort ſtalk, but thick. In the ſame place is found Sorrel, which they uſe too in their food. Some particular herbs they have
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98689:79"/>which are not found any where elſe, as <hi>Calceolum Lapponicum,</hi> or <hi>Braſſica Rangiferorum:</hi> what ſort of herb it is <hi>Sam. Rheen</hi> expreſſes in theſe words, which, tho tedious, I thought fit to tranſcribe that we might have his exact opinion it. There grows (ſaith he) an herb which they call <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceolum Lapponicum</hi> becauſ its flower is like the <hi>Laplanders</hi> ſhoe, it is of a blew colour with three rowes of ſeed in the pod, it has larger leaves than the vulgar cabbage, its ſtalk is a finger thick and the root bitter: it grows extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary faſt, and riſes to three cubits in height, and ſomtimes more: it is thought a bad and unprofitable herb becauſe no beaſt will taſt of it. There is another herb very uſefel and wholeſome, and of great eſteem among them, which <hi>Olaus Pet.</hi> take to be like a carrot, he ſays it is called <hi>Moſaraoth,</hi> have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the taſt and flower of Pimpervel growing in marſhy grounds to an ell in height. That <hi>Moſaraoth</hi> is not a <hi>Lapland</hi> but <hi>Swediſh</hi> name, from <hi>maoſa</hi> which ſignifies marſhy places where moſſe grows, what the inhabitants call it, I cannot yet learn. And theſe are the peculiar herbs which this country hath: I have not met with any one that could help me to the exact ſhape of them. But altho this ſoil beare ſome peculiar herbs, yet there are not many ſpecies of them, which <hi>Olaus Pet.</hi> gathers from the <hi>weſt-Bothnia,</hi> which borders on <hi>Lapland,</hi> for in that place there are found but very few.</p>
               <p>I come now to Moſſe, which is of diverſe ſorts. The firſt is tree Moſſe, with a kind of long wool, hanging down from the boughs, eſpecially of the Pitch tree, and ſomtimes from others. The 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. which is very plentiful and affords food for the raindeers in the winter is ground Moſſe, of a white colour, with long thin leaves growing a foot high. The 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. is ground moſſe, but ſofter of a more delicate yellow green: this is pernicious to the foxes, which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants cut ſmall and mix with their baits to catch them. The 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. is alſo ground moſſe, ſhort and ſoft, of a very fine colour, which becauſ it is ſo fine they uſe inſtead of feathers to lay under Infants new born. I hear of a 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. ſort with larger and longer leaves, which they call <hi>Fathne,</hi> good againſt faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if it be bruiſed and drank in broth, but I doubt whether this be Moſſe, I had rather believe it <hi>Angelica</hi> cut ſmall prepared and boiled under ground. The laſt thing which is to be mentioned is Graſſe, which is of diverſe kinds, the beſt ſort is that which is found in the vallies near the mauntains called <hi>Fells,</hi> being ſhort, ſoft, and juicy; that which grows in other places is thicker, rougher, and dryer. There is a 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> ſort thin and ſlender which the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants uſe for ſtuffing of their ſhoes, and gloves, to defend their feet and hands from the weather. And theſe are all the trees, ſhrubs, and herbs of <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXII.</hi> Of their Mettals.</head>
               <p>THat mettals grow in <hi>Lapland</hi> and the outermoſt parts of <hi>Scandivavia,</hi> is only a conjecture of the Antients, and there is no certainty of it, therefore none of them make any mention of them. <hi>Olaus M.</hi> flatly denies that to his age there were any Iron, Copper, or Silver mines found, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were forced to faſten their boats with oſiers, without any nails becauſe they had no Iron, but in the 35. year of this age, in <hi>Queen Christina's</hi> reign, a ſilver mine was diſcovered by the Inhabitants of <hi>Pitha</hi> near <hi>Naſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fialo</hi> not far from the mountains which divide Swedcland from Norway, this was the firſt mine known in <hi>Lapland,</hi> found by <hi>Loens Perſon</hi> an inhabitant of <hi>Pitha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the year 1645. <hi>The moſt Illuſtrious Ericus Flemming L. Baron of Lais, now Senator of the Kingdome, and Preſident of the company of Mines,</hi> firſt cauſed it to be opened, and a melting-houſe built with convenient neceſſaries. There is alſo a vein of Lead richer then the Silver and eaſier work't. <hi>Rheen</hi> ſaith that the mountain is opened, not with Pickaxes or any Iron inſtruments: but they bore a hole, which muſt be fill'd with Gunpowder; when the mouth is well ſtopt they apply fire thro another little hole, which touching the powder breaks the hardeſt ſtones in pieces. But the uſe of this mine laſted no long time, for in the war between the Swedes and Danes in <hi>Carolus Gustavus</hi> his reign about the year 1958. it was ſpoiled by one <hi>Van Anen</hi> the Daniſh Kings Governour, from which time no man would go to the expence of clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and repairing the mine, becauſe it would require a vaſt charge, before they could get any profit by it, which was too much for men of mean eſtates to undertake.</p>
               <p>The 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Silver mine is in <hi>Luhla-Lapmark</hi> named <hi>Kiedlkievaſi</hi> found by <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan Petri</hi> living in <hi>Torpenjaur</hi> about the 60. year of this age. It is in the middle of the Village <hi>Torpenjaur,</hi> on an high mountain 2. miles from the top, 6. miles from <hi>Raedſtad</hi> a village of <hi>Norway,</hi> between <hi>Raedſtad</hi> and <hi>Keidlkievaſi;</hi> there is a famous high hill called <hi>Daorfiael</hi> in the road that leads from the mine to <hi>Norway:</hi> the foul weather in the winter ſtops all paſſage over this mountain. The mine is rich enough and very broad, continuing the ſame all over, lodged in a hard Marcaſite. It has this inconvenience that there are no woods near it, but they are forced to fetch their fuel a mile and a half off: they uſe powder inſtead of digging it, (as before) the melting-houſe ſtands 5. miles off in a pleaſant place near the concourſe of ſeveral Rivers, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Darijock</hi> and <hi>Quickjock,</hi> which laſt gives the houſe its name. Here is a very ſpacious wood and great plenty of ſhrubs, eſpecially currans, and all forts of herbs. The river affords abundance of the beſt ſort of fiſh as Salmon, Trout, Perch, &amp;c. diſtant 27. miles from <hi>Taorne</hi> diſcovered in 1655. by an nhabitant who was ſhowing the ore to <hi>Ericus Ericſonius</hi> who firſt diſcovered
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98689:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>it. It is very rich and not droſſy, only neceſſary's are conveyed thither with ſome difficulty. There is another 3. miles northward called <hi>Wittange,</hi> found by a <hi>Laplander</hi> in 1668. The vein is not ſo good becauſe mixt with Iron, wherefore they do not dig it ſo willingly as the other; from theſe mines the ore is ſhipt away to the melting-houſe at <hi>Koenge</hi> to be melted and thence brought to <hi>Torna.</hi> There are Iron mines too, one in <hi>Torne-Lapmark</hi> joyning to the Copper mine, another in the ſame <hi>Lapmark</hi> called <hi>Juneſuando</hi> found in 1940. by <hi>Laurence</hi> an inhabitant there, about 22. miles diſtant from <hi>Torna,</hi> whether it is carried to be beaten into bars and rods at the forge at <hi>Koenge.</hi> A 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> vein of the ſame mettal is found in <hi>Pelziwachin</hi> at <hi>Lulha,</hi> but of theſe the two firſt only are digged. I heard in 1671. of a Golden mine: but becauſe there was no certainty, I will not inſiſt upon it. I mention it becauſe there are ſome that affirm that it was found in <hi>Swedeland</hi> in the time of <hi>Guſtavus</hi> the firſt, but this was divulged by an uncertain Author, as appears by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, for to this day nothing more has bin heard of it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP XXXIII.</hi> Of their Stones, Jewels, and Pearls.</head>
               <p>I Come now to their ſtones, which are very large and many, of an aſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour but rough hard and intractable, not to be reduced by any inſtrument to ſhape for uſe. Beſides theſe there are others often found on the ſhores which repreſent the ſhape of an animal. Theſe the inhabitants eſteem much and adore them for Gods, under the name of <hi>Stoorjuncare.</hi> In <hi>Torne-Lapmark</hi> near the mine <hi>Juneſuando,</hi> on the banks of <hi>Torno,</hi> there are found yellow plain ſtones of a circular figure like mony, about the bigneſs of a half crown, which look like dirt, but are as hard as flints. <hi>Dn. Grape</hi> in his papers makes mention of them. I will ſet down a draught of them marked with the letter B. In the mine it ſelf there are found ſtones in the perfect ſhape of <hi>Octaedra,</hi> poliſhed and worked by nature herſelf, but very ſmall not exceeding the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a nut, and ſomtimes leſs. I have put down their figure with the letter C It is not certain whether the loadſtone be found in this Country, tho <hi>Olaus Mag.</hi> ſpeaks of mountains under the pole which ſome have thought do breed the ſtone: his words ſeem to intimate loadſtones as big as mountains, but 'tis certain he cannot mean <hi>Lapland,</hi> for that has none ſuch, yet there are thoſe who affirm that the loadſtone is found there. As for pretious ſtones they have them frequently, <hi>Buraeus</hi> mentions jewels, and afterwards he adds <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, Amethyst,</hi> and <hi>Topaz.</hi> By diamonds he means tranſparent ſtones or Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal, they are found big and little ſticking up and down upon the rocks and craggs: ſome are as big as Childrens heads, ſuch as I ſaw the <hi>Illuſtrious Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel de la Galdie</hi> Chancellour of this kingdom have; they have ſix ſides end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a pyramid, tho ſome of them are imperfect; the colour in ſome is bright and clear not inferior to Chryſtal, in other dull and ſpoiled with flaws, ſome are pure, others have veins like cracks branching out every way,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98689:80"/>they ſerve the inhabitants for flints when they have occaſion to light a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and yield more fire if ſtriken with a ſteel than the flints themſelves. I have now in a <hi>Lapland pouch</hi> ſome Chryſtal which they made uſe of for flints. The Jewellers poliſh and cut their Chryſtals with ſuch art that ſomtimes they are taken for true Diamonds by thoſe that have skill. I have drawn the greater ſort of Chryſtal in the native bigneſs &amp; ſhape, marked with the letter A. <hi>Buraeus</hi> mentions <hi>Amethyſts</hi> next, ſome of which I ſaw brought out of <hi>Lapland,</hi> but ſo pale and ſpotted that they were ſcarce comparable to thoſe that come out of <hi>Bohem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a</hi> tho I hear ſince that there are much better found, cut rarely. The ſame thing is to be ſaid of the <hi>Topaz,</hi> one of which I have in my ſtudy, in every thing like a Chryſtal, only the colour inclines to a yellow. I am told that none of the reſt doe ſhine ſo much as thoſe that come from other places, which is the fault of almoſt all the jewels of this Nation, not being ſo apt to bare lively brisk colours as the eaſtern jewels doe. To this head I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all Pearls and Margarites, tho they be not ſtones. Some rivers in <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> produce theſe, therefore there are certain inhabitants appointed to dive
<figure>
                     <figDesc>depiction of various precious stones</figDesc>
                  </figure> and ſearch for them, ſuch as was <hi>John Peterſon,</hi> mentioned by <hi>S. Rheen,</hi> who firſt found the Silver mine at <hi>Naſaſiael,</hi> he is called <hi>een diamontzbryeare ſampi partefoekiare i. e.</hi> one that finds and cuts pearls. Which (tho out of this Country) are not contemptible, it cannot be denied but that moſt of them want that livelineſs which the oriental Pearls have, tho ſome are found as good, and in bigneſs and ſhape exceeding them. There are found ſome not come to perfection, half round and half ſlat, the round part being bright the other yellow and dull. I ſaw one a few years agoe brought out of <hi>Bothnia,</hi> ſo exactly round with ſuch freſh colours, that a certain woman offered an 120. crowns for it, a Jeweller aſſured me that if he had another as good, he would not ſell both for 500. They are bred not of ſuch ſhells as are in the eaſt broad, plane, and almoſt circular like Oiſter, but longer and hollower like Muſcle ſhels, and not in the Sea but in Rivers, as may be gathered from <hi>Olaus Magnus.</hi> Thoſe that are not come to perfection ſtick within the ſhells, but thoſe that are perfect, are looſe and drop out when the ſhell is opened.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXIV.</hi> Of their Rivers.</head>
               <p>LApland if any Country is well watered with ſprings and rivers: the moſt noted are thoſe from whence the particular marches and regions have their names, as <hi>Umeao, Pitheao, Luhleao, Torneao,</hi> and <hi>Kimeao,</hi> theſe ſpring from the <hi>Norway</hi> mountains, and are encreaſed by ſeveral leſs rivers, unburdening themſelves at laſt into the <hi>Bothnick</hi> Sea. <hi>Vindela</hi> fills <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>meao,</hi> and <hi>Skiellefle Pitheao, Luhleao</hi> ſwallows a leſs river of the ſame name, and <hi>Kimeao</hi> is encreaſed by <hi>Avilaiocki,</hi> which it ſelf is no ſmall river, for there are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs rivulets which run into it. So <hi>Luhleao</hi> which has a double ſtream, the leſſer receives <hi>Pyrrijaus Kardijoch,</hi> and it is the ſame caſe with the greater called <hi>Stoor-Luhleao,</hi> and <hi>Tornaeo</hi> which is filled with the river <hi>Kaeungemae Taengeleao</hi> and others. And ſo it is with all the great rivers, which upon that account are ſo impetuous and big, that they yield to few in the world: and becauſe they run through hilly and uneven Countrys, and are ſtopt by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral dams &amp; wears, they force their way over precipices, with a great noiſe, and in thoſe places are not navigable. Such is the ſluce at <hi>Lughlens,</hi> called <hi>Muſkaumokke,</hi> and another named <hi>Sao,</hi> likewiſe <hi>Niometſaſki</hi> i. e. an Hares leap, ſo called becauſe the river <hi>Lughla</hi> runs between two mountains ſo near that an Hare may leap over.</p>
               <p>The like <hi>Cataracts</hi> are found at <hi>Torna,</hi> the moſt remarkable is called <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rafors</hi> near the <hi>Norway</hi> mountains. Next <hi>Caengerbrooks-fors</hi> then <hi>Lappia-fors,</hi> then three more meeting in an head called by one name <hi>Paelloforſer,</hi> next <hi>Kettille-fors</hi> and laſtly <hi>Kukula-fors</hi> near <hi>Torna.</hi> Although theſe <hi>Cataracts</hi> are a great hindrance to ſailers, yet they are advantagious to the mettal-melters, and afford an incredible plenty of Fiſh. Beſides theſe rivers there are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of pooles, ſo numerous that but few can be named, one is <hi>Lulafraesk</hi> by <hi>Lughla,</hi> by which <hi>Lughleao</hi> the greater runs. Next <hi>Lugga</hi> and <hi>Sabbaig</hi> all abounding with Salmons. By the leſſer <hi>Lughleao</hi> are <hi>Saggatt, Ritfack, Pirri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaur, Skalka, Sittijock, waykijaur,</hi> and <hi>Karra-green</hi> which exceeds them all, each affording plenty of Fiſh. <hi>Pitha</hi> has theſe remarkable ones near it, <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſvandijaur, Arfuſſierf, Pieskejaur,</hi> but eſpecially <hi>Stoorafuan</hi> in which there are as many Ilands as daies in the year; but above all <hi>Enareſraesk</hi> near <hi>Kimue. Wexionius</hi> ſaith the Hills and Ilands in it are innumerable, and without an hyperbole, for <hi>Tornaeus</hi> affirmes that never any inhabitant lived long enough to ſurvey them all.</p>
               <p>There be ſome Marſhes, little but full of Fiſh, in that language called <hi>Suino</hi> i. e. holy, and they account it a ſin to foul them. Theſe marches have two Channels one above the other: ſomtimes it happens that the fiſh leave the upper and retreat into the lower, upon which account the ſuperſtitious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives bring ſacrifice to appeaſe the <hi>Damon</hi> of that marſh whom they ſuppoſe to be angry.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXV.</hi> Of their Mountains.</head>
               <p>THeir land which I treat of laſt, is not in the ſame condition all over, for that which is near <hi>Bothnia</hi> is wholſomer and more fertile for all ſort of pot-herbs, as thoſe can witneſs who have made gardens in both ſoils. They found that ſome places would bear coleworts, raperoots, parſnips, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhes and the like. In other places by reaſon of the abundance of rocks and rivers, the ground is too moiſt and ſtony, and ſandy in many places, which being ſcattered by the wind covers the ground like ſnow, ſuch are thoſe places near the mountains of <hi>Norway.</hi> Theſe ſands make a very dangerous paſſage for travellors, eſpecially when they are covered with ſnow, becauſe then they cannot tell what they are to avoid, ſomtimes falling in and being overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Towards <hi>Norway,</hi> are very high mountains which the <hi>Swedes</hi> call <hi>Fiael</hi> the <hi>Laplanders Tudderi. Cluverius</hi> calleth the top of the mountains <hi>Sevo</hi> which he took from <hi>Pliny</hi> l. 4. c. 13. By <hi>Adamus</hi> they are called <hi>Riphaei,</hi> but he was to careleſs in looking over <hi>Pliny, Solinus,</hi> and <hi>Oroſius.</hi> But whatever the name is, what <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith is true of the mountain, that it is no leſs than the <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaean;</hi> the top is perpetually covered with ſnow. Moreover the aſcent and riſe of this mount is thus deſcribed by <hi>Pet. Nevren:</hi> the mountain which ſeparates <hi>Norway</hi> from <hi>Lappia</hi> begins to riſe about <hi>Zemptland;</hi> thence with continued aſcent towards the north it reaches a hundred miles, till it comes to <hi>Titus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiord,</hi> which is a bay of the frozen ſea. By this mountain the provinces of <hi>Swede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are divided from <hi>Norway,</hi> as by a wall deſigned by nature herſelf. But altho theſe mountains are one continued tract, yet they ſwell higher in ſome places than others, called by theſe diſtinct names, which <hi>Samuel Rheen</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Waeſawaari, Skipoive, Naſawari, Ceruioiue, Kioldawaari, Niottus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wagg, Keidtkiwaari, Zeknawaari, Fierrowaari, Cardawaari, Steikawaari, Skalopacht, Darrawaari, Woggouſaari, Niynnas, Kaskaoiue, Wallawaari, Ski<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eldawaari, Harrawaari, Portawaari, Kafla, Seggock <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltivis.</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner there are many other of their names in the other parts of this Country, but becauſe it is hard to meet with them all, and not ſo much to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, wee'l end now.</p>
